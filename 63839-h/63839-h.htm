<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>La</span> musique,” says Marmontel, with the same
odd confusion of thought and language which leads
him to give his very equivocal narratives the title
of “<span class='it'>Contes Moraux</span>”—“la musique est le seul des
talens qui jouissent de lui même; tous les autres
veulent des temoins.” He here confounds the
pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the
capacity for creating them. No more than any
other <span class='it'>talent</span>, is that for music susceptible of complete
enjoyment, where there is no second party to
appreciate its exercise. And it is only in common
with other talents that it produces <span class='it'>effects</span> which
may be fully enjoyed in solitude. The idea which
the <span class='it'>raconteur</span> has either failed to entertain clearly,
or has sacrificed, in its expression, to his national
love of <span class='it'>point</span>, is, doubtless, the very tenable one
that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly
estimated when we are the most exclusively
alone. The proposition, in this form, will be
admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its
own sake, and for its spiritual uses. But there is
one pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality—and
perhaps only one—which owes even
more than does music to the accessory sentiment
of seclusion. I mean the happiness experienced in
the contemplation of natural scenery. In truth,
the man who would behold aright the glory of God
upon earth must in solitude behold that glory. To
me, at least, the presence—not of human life only—but
of life in any other form than that of the green
things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless—is
a stain upon the landscape—is at war with
the genius of the scene. I love, indeed, to regard
the dark valleys, and the grey rocks, and the waters
that silently smile, and the forests that sigh in uneasy
slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains
that look down upon all—I love to regard these
as themselves but the colossal members of one vast
animate and sentient whole—a whole whose form
(that of the sphere) is the most perfect and the
most inclusive of all; whose path is among associate
planets; whose meek handmaiden is the
moon; whose mediate sovereign is the sun; whose
life is eternity; whose intelligence is that of a God;
whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies
are lost in immensity; whose cognizance of ourselves
is akin with our own cognizance of the animalculæ
in crystal, or of those which infest the
brain—a being which we, in consequence, regard
as purely inanimate and material, much in the same
manner as these animalculæ must thus regard us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our telescopes, and our mathematical investigations
assure us on every hand—notwithstanding
the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood—that
space, and therefore that bulk, is an important
consideration in the eyes of the Almighty. The
cycles in which the stars move are those best
adapted for the evolution, without collision, of the
greatest possible number of bodies. The forms of
these bodies are accurately such as, within a given
surface, to include the greatest possible amount of
matter;—while the surfaces themselves are so disposed
as to accommodate a denser population than
could be accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise
arranged. Nor is it any argument against
bulk being an object with God, that space itself is
infinite; for there may be an infinity of matter to
fill it. And since we see clearly that the endowment
of matter with vitality is a principle—indeed
as far as our judgments extend, the <span class='it'>leading</span> principle—in
the operations of Deity—it is scarcely logical
to imagine that it is confined to the regions of the
minute, where we daily trace it, and that it does
not extend to those of the august. As we find
cycle within cycle without end—yet all revolving
around one far-distant centre which is the God-head,
may we not analogically suppose, in the same
manner, life within life, the less within the greater,
and all within the Spirit Divine? In short, we are
madly erring, through self-esteem, in believing man,
in either his temporal or future destinies, to be of
more moment in the universe than that vast “clod
of the valley” which he tills and contemns, and to
which he denies a soul for no more profound
reason than that he does not behold its operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These fancies, and such as these, have always
given to my meditations among the mountains, and
the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, a tinge of
what the every-day world would not fail to term
the fantastic. My wanderings amid such scenes
have been many, and far-searching, and often solitary;
and the interest with which I have strayed
through many a dim deep valley, or gazed into the
reflected Heaven of many a bright lake, has been
an interest greatly deepened by the thought that
I have strayed and gazed <span class='it'>alone</span>. What flippant
Frenchman was it who said, in allusion to the
well-known work of Zimmerman, that “<span class='it'>la solitude
est une belle chose; mais il faut quelqu ’un pour vous
dire que la solitude est une belle chose</span>?” The
epigram cannot be gainsayed; but the necessity is
a thing that does not exist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was during one of my lonely journeyings,
amid a far-distant region of mountain locked within
mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarns
writhing or sleeping within all—that I chanced
upon the rivulet and the island which are the subject
of our engraving. I came upon them suddenly
in the leafy June, and threw myself upon the turf,
beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub,
that I might doze as I contemplated the scene. I
felt that thus only should I look upon it, such was
the character of phantasm which it wore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On all sides—save to the west, where the sun
was about sinking—arose the verdant walls of the
forest. The little river, which turned sharply in its
course, and was thus immediately lost to sight,
seemed to have no exit from its prison, but to be
absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees to
the east—while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared
to me as I lay at length and glanced
upward) there poured down noiselessly and continuously
into the valley, a rich, golden and crimson
waterfall from the sun-set fountains of the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About midway in the short vista which my
dreamy vision took in, one small circular island,
fantastically verdured, reposed upon the bosom of
the stream.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>So blended bank and shadow there,</p>
<p class='line0'>That each seemed pendulous in air—</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>so mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was
scarcely possible to say at what point upon the
slope of the emerald turf its crystal dominion
began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My position enabled me to include in a single
view both the eastern and western extremities of
the islet; and I observed a singularly-marked difference
in their aspects. The latter was all one
radiant harem of garden beauties. It glowed and
blushed beneath the eye of the slant sunlight, and
fairly laughed with flowers. The grass was short,
springy, sweet-scented, and Asphodel-interspersed.
The trees were lithe, mirthful, erect—bright, slender
and graceful—of eastern figure and foliage, with
bark smooth, glossy, and particolored. There
seemed a deep sense of life and of joy about all;
and although no airs blew from out the Heavens,
yet every thing had motion through the gentle
sweepings to and fro of innumerable butterflies, that
might have been mistaken for tulips with wings.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The other, or eastern end of the isle was
whelmed in the blackest shade. A sombre, yet
beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded all
things. The trees were dark in color and mournful
in form and attitude—wreathing themselves into
sad, solemn, and spectral shapes, that conveyed
ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death. The
grass wore the deep tint of the cypress, and the
heads of its blades hung droopingly, and, hither and
thither among it, were many small unsightly hillocks,
low, and narrow, and not very long, that had
the aspect of graves, but were not, although over
and all about them the rue and the rosemary clambered.
The shade of the trees fell heavily upon the
water, and seemed to bury itself therein, impregnating
the depths of the element with darkness. I
fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended
lower and lower, separated itself sullenly from the
trunk that gave it birth, and thus became absorbed
by the stream; while other shadows issued momently
from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors
entombed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This idea, having once seized upon my fancy,
greatly excited it, and I lost myself forthwith in
reverie. “If ever island were enchanted,”—said I
to myself,—“this is it. This is the haunt of the
few gentle Fays who remain from the wreck of the
race. Are these green tombs theirs?—or do they
yield up at all their sweet lives as mankind yield up
their own? In dying, do they not rather waste away
mournfully; rendering unto God their existence
little by little, as these trees render up shadow after
shadow, exhausting their substances unto dissolution?
What the wasting tree is to the water that
imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker by what it
preys upon, may not the life of the Fay be to the
Death which engulfs it?—but what fairy-like form
is this which glides so solemnly along the water?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the
sun rapidly sank to rest, and eddying currents careered
round and round the island, bearing upon
their bosom large, dazzling white flakes of the bark
of the sycamore—flakes which, in their multiform
positions upon the water, a quick imagination might
have converted into anything it pleased—while I
thus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one
of those very Fays about whom I had been pondering,
made its way slowly into the darkness from out
the light at the western end of the island. She
stood erect in a singularly fragile canoe, and urged
it with the mere phantom of an oar. While within
the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude
seemed indicative of joy—but sorrow deformed it
as she passed within the shade. Slowly she glided
along, and at length rounded the islet and re-entered
the region of light. “The revolution which has
just been made by the Fay,”—continued I musingly—“is
the cycle of the brief year of her life.
She has floated through her winter and through her
summer. She is a year nearer to Death; for I did
not fail to see that as she came into the shade,
her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed
up in the dark water, making its blackness more
black.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again the boat appeared, and the Fay;—but
about the attitude of the latter there was more of
care and uncertainty, and less of elastic joy. She
floated again from out the light, and into the gloom,
(which deepened momently) and again her shadow
fell from her into the ebony water, and became absorbed
into its blackness. And again and again
she made the circuit of the island, (while the sun
rushed down to his slumbers;) and at each issuing
forth into the light, there was more sorrow about
her person, while it grew feebler, and far fainter,
and more indistinct; and at each passage into the
gloom, there fell from her a darker shade, which
became whelmed in a shadow more black. But at
length, when the sun had utterly departed, the Fay,
now the mere ghost of her former self, went disconsolately
with her boat into the region of the ebony
flood—and that she issued thence at all I cannot
say,—for darkness fell over all things, and I beheld
her magical figure no more.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “CRUISING IN THE LAST WAR.”</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE SHIP’S BOY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Hillo</span>!” said Westbrook, “who’s skulking
here?” and he pushed his foot against a dark
heap, huddled up under the shade of one of the
guns. As he did so, a slight, pale-faced, sickly-looking
boy started up. “Ah! it’s you, Dick, is
it?—why I never before thought you’d skulk—there,
go—but you mustn’t do it again, my lad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy was a favorite with all on board. He
had embarked at Newport, and was, therefore, a
new hand, but his quiet demeanor, as well as a
certain melancholy expression of face he always
wore, had won him a way to our hearts. Little
was known of his history, except that he was an
orphan. Punctual in the discharge of his duties,
yet holding himself aloof from the rest of the boys,
he seemed to be one, who although he had determined
to endure his present fate, was yet conscious
of having seen better days. I was the more confirmed
in my belief that he had been born to a
higher station from the choice of his words in
conversation, especially with his superiors. His
manner, too, was not that of one brought up to
buffett roughly against fortune. That one so young
should be thrust, unaided, out into the world, was a
sure passport for him to my heart, for his want of
parents was a link of sympathy uniting us together;
and we had, therefore, always been as much friends
as the relative difference of our situations, on board
a man-of-war would allow. Yet even I, so great
was his reserve, knew little more of his history than
the rest of my shipmates. Once, indeed, when I
had rendered him some little kindness, such as an
officer always has it in his power without much
trouble to himself, to bestow upon an inferior, his
heart had opened, and he had told me, more by
hints though than in direct words, that he had lost
his father and mother and a little sister, within a
few weeks of each other, and that, houseless, penniless
and friendless, he had been forced to sea by
his only remaining relatives, in order that he might
shift for himself. I suspected that he did not pass
under his real name. But whatever had been his
former lot, or however great were his sufferings, he
never repined. He went through his duty silently,
but sadly, as if—poor child!—he carried within
him a breaking heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, sir,” said he, in reply to Westbrook’s address,
“it’s but a minute any how I’ve been here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, Dick, I believe you,” said the
warm-hearted midshipman. “But there go eight
bells, and as your watch is up, you may go below.
What! crying—fie, fie, my lad, how girl-hearted
you have grown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not girl-hearted always,” sobbed the
little fellow, looking up into his superior’s face,
“but I couldn’t help crying when I thought that
to-night a year ago my mother died, and I crept
under the gun so that no one might see and laugh
at me, as they do at every one here. It was just
at this hour she died,” he continued, chokingly,
bursting into a fit of uncontrollable weeping, “and
she was the only friend I had on earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor boy! God bless you!” said Westbrook,
mentally, as the lad, finishing his passionate exclamation,
turned hastily away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was my watch, and as Westbrook met me
coming on deck, he paused a moment, and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know any thing about that poor little
fellow, I mean Dick Rasey? God help me I’ve
been rating him for skulking, when the lad only
wanted to hide his grief for his mother from the
jests of the crew. I wouldn’t have done it for
any thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—he has always maintained the greatest
reserve respecting himself. Has he gone below?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! who can he be? It’s strange I feel
such an interest in him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor child!—he has seen better days, and this
hard life is killing him. I wish he could distinguish
himself some how—the skipper might then take a
fancy to him and put him on the quarter-deck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a dear little middy he would make,” said
Westbrook, his gay humor flashing out through his
sadness, “why we havn’t got a cocked-hat aboard
that wouldn’t bury him up like an extinguisher, or
a dirk to spare which isn’t longer than his whole
body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shame, Jack—its not a matter for jest—the
lad is dying by inches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! you’re right, Parker; I wish to heaven
the boy had a berth aft here. But now I must go
below, for I’m confoundedly sleepy. You’ll have
a lighter watch of it than I had. The moon will
be up directly—and there, by Jove! she comes—look
how gloriously her disc slides up behind that
wave. But this is no time for poetry, for I’m as
drowsy as if I was about to sleep, like the old
fellow in the Arabian story, for a matter of a
hundred years or more, or even like the seven
sleepers of Christendom, who fell into a doze some
centuries back, and will come to life again the Lord
knows when,” and with a long yawn, my mercurial
messmate gave a parting glance at the rising luminary,
and went below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spectacle to which Westbrook had called
my attention was indeed a glorious one. The
night had been somewhat misty, so that the stars
were obscured, or but faintly visible here and there;
while the light breeze that scarcely ruffled the sea,
or sighed above a whisper in the rigging, had given
an air of profound repose to the scene. When I
first stept on deck the whole horizon was buried in
this partial obscurity, and the view around, excepting
in the vicinity of the Fire-Fly, was lost in
misty indistinctness. A few moments, however,
had changed the aspect of the whole scene.
When I relieved the watch the eastern horizon
was shrouded in a veil of dark, thick vapors—for
the mists had collected there in denser masses than
any where else—while a single star, through a
rent in the midst of that weird-like canopy, shone
calmly upon the scene: but now the fog had lifted
up like a curtain from the seaboard in that quarter,
and a long greenish streak of light, stretching along
for several points, and against which the dark waves
undulated in bold relief, betokened the approach of
the moon. Even as Westbrook spoke, the upper
edge of her disc slid up above the watery horizon,
disappearing and appearing again as the surges rose
and fell against it, until gradually the huge globe
lifted its whole vast volume above the seaboard,
and while the edge of the dark canopy above shone
as if lined with pearl, a flood of glorious light,
flickering and dancing upon the billows, was poured
in a long line of molten silver across the sea toward
us, bathing hull, and spars, and sails in liquid radiance,
and seeming to transpose us in a moment
into a fairy land. Such a scene of unrivalled
beauty I had never beheld. The contrast betwixt
the dark vapors hanging over the moon, and the
dazzling brilliancy of her wake below was indeed
magnificent. I looked in mute delight. The few
stars above were at once obscured by the brighter
glories of the moon. Suddenly, however, as I gazed,
a dark speck appeared upon the surface of the moon,
and in another instant the tall masts and exquisite
tracery of a ship could be seen, in bold relief against
her disc, the fine dark lines of the hamper seeming
like the thinnest cobwebs crossing a burnished
shield of silver. So plainly was the vessel seen
that her minutest spars were perceptible as she rose
and fell gallantly on the long heavy swell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! my fine fellow,” I exclaimed, “we have
you there. Had it not been for yonder pretty
mistress of the night you would have passed us
unseen. Make all sail at once—and bear up a
few points more so as to get the weather gauge of
the stranger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How gallantly the old schooner eats into the
wind,” I said, gazing with admiration on our
light little craft. I turned to the chase. “Has
the stranger altered her course?” I asked, looking
for her in the old position, but finding she was no
more visible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir, I saw her but an instant ago: oh!
there she is—that fog bank settling down on the
seaboard hid her from sight. You can see her
now just to leeward of the moon, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked, and as the man had said, perceived
that the dark massy bank of vapors, which had
lifted as the moon rose, was once more settling
down on the seaboard, obscuring her whole disc at
intervals, and shrouding every thing in that quarter
in occasional gloom. For a moment the strange
sail had been lost in this obscurity, but as the moon
struggled through the clouds, it once more became
visible just under the northern side of that luminary.
Apparently unconscious of our vicinity the stranger
was stealing gently along under easy sail, pitching
upon the long undulating swell, while, as he lay
almost in the very wake of the moon, every part of
his hull and rigging was distinctly perceptible. Not
a yard, however, appeared to have been moved: not
an additional sail was set. Occasionally we lost
sight of him as the moon, wading heavily through
the sombre clouds, became momentarily obscured,
although even then, from beneath the frowning
canopy of vapors above, a silvery radiance would
steal out at the edges of the clouds, tipping the
masts and sails of the stranger with a soft pearly
light that looked like enchantment itself, and which,
contrasted with the dark hues of the hull and the
gloomy deep beneath, produced an effect such as I
have never seen surpassed in nature or art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the wind gradually failed us, until at
length it fell a dead calm. All this time the fog
was settling down more heavily around us, not
gathering in one compact mass however, but lying
in patches scattered over the whole expanse of the
waters, and presenting a picture such as no one,
except he is familiar with a tropical sea, can imagine.
In some places the ocean was entirely clear
of the fog, while a patch of cold, blue sky above,
spangled with innumerable stars, that shone with a
brilliancy unknown to colder climes, looked as if
cut out of the mists, which on every hand around
covered the sky as with a veil. At times a light
breeze would spring up ruffling the polished surface
of the swell, and, undulating the fog as smoke-wreaths
in the morning air, would open up, for a
moment, a sight of some new patch of blue sky
above, with its thousand brightly twinkling stars, reminding
one of the beautiful skies we used to
dream of in our infant slumbers, and then, dying
away as suddenly as it arose, the mists would
undulate uncertainly an instant, roll toward each
other, and twisting around in a thousand fantastic
folds, would finally close up, shrouding the sky
once more in gloom, and settling down bodily upon
the sombre surface of the deep. At length the
moon became wholly obscured. A few stars only
could be seen flickering fainter and fainter far up
in the fathomless ether, and finally, after momentarily
appearing and disappearing, they vanished
altogether. A profound gloom hung on all around.
The silence of death reigned over our little craft.
Even the customary sounds of the swell rippling
along our sides, or the breeze sighing through the
hamper faded entirely, and save an occasional
creaking of the boom, or the sullen falling of a
reef-point against the sail, not a sound broke the
repose of the scene. The strange sail had long
since been lost sight of to starboard. So profound
was the darkness that we could scarcely distinguish
the look-out at the forecastle from the quarter-deck.
Silent and motionless we lay, shut in by that dark
shroud of vapor, as if buried by some potent enchanter
in a living tomb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hist!” said a reefer of my watch to me, “don’t
you hear something, Mr. Parker?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I listened, attentively, and though my hearing
was proverbially sharp, I could distinguish nothing
for several moments. At length, however, the little
fellow pinched my arm, and inclining my eye to the
water, I heard a low monotonous sound like the
smothered rollicking of oars that had been muffled.
At first I could not credit my senses, but, as I
listened again, the sound came more distinctly to
my ears, seeming to grow nearer and nearer.
There could be no mistaking it. Directly, moreover,
these sounds ceased, and then was heard a
low murmured noise, as if human voices were
conversing together in stifled tones. At once
it flashed upon me that an attack was contemplated
upon us—by whom I knew not—though it was
probable that the enemy came from the strange
sail to starboard. It was evident, however, that
the assailants were at fault. My measures were
taken at once. Hastily ordering the watch to arm
themselves in quiet, I ordered the men to be called
silently; and, as by this time the look-outs began
to detect the approach of our unknown visitors, I
enjoined equal silence upon them, commanding
them at the same time, however, to keep a sharp
eye to starboard, in order to learn, if possible, the
exact position of the expected assailants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few minutes the men were mustered, and
prepared for the visitors, whether peaceful or not.
Most of the officers, too, had found their way on
deck, although as it was uncertain as yet whether
it might not be a false alarm, I had not disturbed
the skipper. Westbrook was already, however,
prepared for the fight, and as I ran my eye hastily
over the crew I thought I saw the slight form of
Dick Rasey, standing amongst them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you hear any thing, Westbrook?” said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s like the grave!” was his whispered answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pass the word on for the men to keep perfectly
quiet, but to remain at their stations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some minutes the death-like silence which
had preceded the discovery of our unknown visitors
returned, and as moment after moment crept by
without betraying the slightest token of the vicinity
of the assailants, I almost began to doubt my
senses, and believe that the sounds I had heard
had been imaginary. The most profound obscurity
meantime reigned over our decks. So great was the
darkness that I could only distinguish a shadowy
group of human beings gathered forward, without
being able to discern distinctly any one face or
figure; while the only sound I heard, breaking
the hush around, was the deep, but half-suppressed
breathing of our men. Suddenly, however, when
our suspense had become exciting even to nervousness,
a low, quick sound was heard right off our
starboard quarter, as if one or more boats, with
muffled oars, were pulling swiftly on to us; while
almost instantaneously a dark mass shot out of the
gloom on that side, and before we could realise the
rapidity of their approach, the boat had struck our
side, and her crew were tumbling in over the bulwarks,
cutlass in hand. Our preparation took
them, however, by surprise, and for a moment they
recoiled, but instantly rallying at their leader’s voice,
they poured in upon us again with redoubled fierceness,
cheering as they clambered up our sides, and
struggled over the bulwarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beat them back, Fire-Flies!” I shouted, “give
it to them with a will, boys—strike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Press on, my lads, press on—the schooner’s
our own!” shouted the leader of the assailants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Levelling my pistol at the advancing speaker,
and waving our men on with my sword, I gave
him no answer, but fired. The pistol flashed in
the pan. In an instant the leader of the foe was
upon me, having sprung over the bulwarks as I
spoke. He was a tall, athletic man, and lifting his
sword high above his head, while in his other hand
he presented a pistol toward my breast, he dashed
upon me. I parried his thrust with my blade, but
as he fired I felt a sharp pain in my arm, like the
puncture of a pin. I knew that I was wounded,
but it only inspired me with fiercer energy. I
made a lunge at him, but he met it with a blow of
his sword, which shivered my weapon to atoms.
Springing upon my gigantic adversary, I wreathed
my arms around him, and endeavored to make up
for the want of a weapon, by bearing him to the
deck in my arms; but my utmost exertions, desperate
as they were, scarcely sufficed to stagger
him, and shortening his blade, he was about plunging
it into my heart, when a pistol went off close
beside me, and my antagonist, giving a convulsive
leap, fell dead upon the deck. I freed myself
from his embrace and sprang to my feet, just in
time to see little Dick, with the smoke still wreathing
from the mouth of his pistol, borne away by
the press of the assault. In the next instant I lost
sight of him in the melee, which now became really
terrific. Hastily snatching a brand from one of the
fallen men, I plunged once more into the fight, for
the enemy having been by this time reinforced by
another boat, were now pouring in upon us in such
numbers that the arm of every man became absolutely
necessary. It was indeed a desperate contest.
Hand to hand and foot to foot we fought;
desperation on the one hand, and a determination to
conquer on the other, lent double fury to our crew;
while the clash of swords, the explosion of fire-arms,
the shouts of the combatants, and the groans and
shrieks of the wounded and dying, gave additional
horror to the scene. By this time our captain had
reached the deck, and his powerful voice was heard
over all the din of the battle urging on his men.
The fall of the enemy’s leader began now to be
generally known among his crew, and the consequence
was soon apparent in their wavering and
want of unity. In vain the inferior officers urged
them on; in vain they found their retreat cut off by
the shot we had hove into their boats; in vain they
were reminded by their leaders that they must now
conquer or die, they no longer fought with the
fierceness of their first onset, and though they still
combatted manfully, and some of them desperately,
they had lost all unity of purpose, and, struck with
a sudden panic, at a last overwhelming charge of
our gallant followers, they fled in disorder, some
leaping wildly overboard, some crying for quarter
when they could retreat no farther, and all of them
giving up the contest as lost. Not a soul escaped.
They who did not fall in the strife were either
drowned in the panic-struck flight, or made prisoners.
The whole contest did not last seven
minutes. When they found themselves deserted by
their men the officers sullenly resigned their swords,
and we found that our assailants were a cutting
out party from the ship to starboard, an English
frigate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man-of-war had not, it seems, discovered us
until some time after the moon arose, when her
light, happening to fall full upon our sails, betrayed
us to their look-outs. The darkness almost directly
afterward obscured us from sight, and the calm that
ensued forbade her reaching us herself. Her boats
were consequently manned, with the intention of
carrying us by boarding. The most singular portion
of it was that none of us perceived that the
stranger was a man-of-war, but this may be accounted
for from her being built after a new model,
which gave her the appearance of a merchantman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bustle of the fight was over; the prisoners
had been secured; the decks had been washed
down; my wound which turned out slight had been
properly attended to; and the watch had once more
resumed their monotonous tread; while at proper
intervals, the solemn cry, “all’s well,” repeated
from look-out to look-out, betokened that we were
once more in security, before I sought my hammock.
I soon fell asleep, but throughout the night
I was troubled by wild dreams in which Beatrice,
the ship’s boy, and the late strife, were mingled
promiscuously. At length I awoke. It was still
dark, and the only light near was a single lantern
hung at the extremity of the apartment. My fellow
messmates around were all buried in sleep. Suddenly,
the surgeon’s mate stood beside me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Parker!” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I raised myself up and gazed curiously into his
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little Dick, sir—” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God!” I exclaimed, for I had actually forgotten,
in the excitement of the combat and the
succeeding events, to enquire about my young preserver,
and I now felt a strange presentiment that
the mate had come to acquaint me with his death—“what
of him? Is any thing the matter?” I asked
eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear, sir,” said the messenger, shaking his
head sadly, “that he cannot live till morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I have been lying here,” I exclaimed, reproachfully,
“while the poor boy is dying,” and I
sprang at once from my hammock, hurried on my
clothes, saying, “lead me to him at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is delirious, but in the intervals of lunacy
he asks for you, sir,” and as the man spoke we
stood by bedside of the dying boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sufferer did not lie in his usual hammock,
for it was hung in the very midst of the crew, and
the close air around it was really stifling; but he
had been carried to a place, nearly under the open
hatchway, and laid there in a little open space of
about four feet square. From the sound of the
ripples I judged the schooner was in motion, while
the clear calm blue sky, seen through the opening
overhead and dotted with myriads of stars, betokened
that the fog had broken away. How calmly
it smiled down on the wan face of the dying boy.
Occasionally a light current of wind—oh! how
deliciously cool in that pent-up hold—eddied down
the hatchway, and lifted the dark chesnut locks of
the sufferer, as, with his little head reposing in the
lap of an old veteran, he lay in an unquiet slumber.
His shirt-collar was unbuttoned, and his childish
bosom, as white as that of a girl, was open and exposed.
He breathed quick and heavily. The wound
of which he was dying, had been intensely painful,
but within the last half hour had somewhat lulled,
though even now his thin fingers tightly grasped
the bed-clothes as if he suffered the greatest agony.
Another battle-stained and gray-haired seaman stood
beside him, holding a dull lantern in his hand, and
gazing sorrowfully down upon the sufferer. The
surgeon knelt beside him, with his finger on the
boy’s pulse. As I approached they all looked up.
The veteran who held him shook his head, and
would have spoken, but the tears gathered too
chokingly in his eyes. The surgeon said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is going fast,—poor little fellow—do you
see this?” and as he spoke he lifted up a rich gold
locket, which had lain upon the boy’s breast. “He
has seen better days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could not answer, for my heart was full. Here
was the being to whom, but a few hours before I
had owed my life—a poor, slight, unprotected
child—lying before me, with death already written
on his brow,—and yet I had never known of his
danger, and never even sought him out after the
conflict. How bitterly my heart reproached me in
that hour. They noticed my agitation, and his old
friend—the seaman that held his head—said sadly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor little Dick—you’ll never see the shore
again you have wished for so long. But there’ll
be more than one—thank God!—when your log’s
out, to mourn over you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the little fellow opened his eyes, and
gazed vacantly around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has he come yet?” he asked in a low voice.
“Why won’t he come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am here,” said I, taking the little fellow’s
hand, “don’t you know me, Dick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doctor, I am dying, ain’t I?” said the little
fellow, “for my sight grows dim. God bless you,
Mr. Parker, for this. I see you now,” and he
faintly pressed my hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I do nothing for you, Dick?” said I, “you
saved my life. God knows I would coin my own
blood to buy yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have nothing to ask, only, if it be possible,
let me be buried by my mother,—you will find the
name of the place, and all about it, in my trunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything—everything, my poor lad,” I answered
chokingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little fellow smiled faintly—it was like an
angel’s smile—but he did not answer. His eyes
were fixed on the stars flickering in that patch of
blue sky, far overhead. His mind wandered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a long—long way up there,—but there
are bright angels among them. Mother used
to say that I would meet her there. How near
they come, and I see bright faces smiling on me
from them. Hark! is that music?” and, lifting his
finger, he seemed listening intently for a moment.
He fell back; and the old veteran burst into tears.
The child was dead. Did he indeed hear angels’
voices? God grant it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I opened his trunk, and then discovered his real
name. Out of mercy to the unfeeling wretches,
who were his relatives, and who had forced him to
sea, I suppress it. Suffice it to say, his family had
once been rich, but that reverses had come upon
them. His father died of a broken heart, nor did
his mother long survive. Poor boy! I could not
fulfil the whole of his injunction, for we were far
out at sea, but I caused a cenotaph to be erected
for him beside his mother’s grave. It tells the simple
tale of <span class='sc'>The Ship’s Boy</span>.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY H. J. VERNON.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Well</span> flown, falcon—see how it mounts into
the clouds—the heron has it—on, on knights and
ladies fair, or we shall not be in at the death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the speaker ceased, the falcon, which had
been mounting in gyrations growing narrower and
narrower as it ascended above its prey, suddenly
stooped from its height, and shooting upon the
heron, like a thunderbolt, bore the huge bird in its
talons to the earth. The swoop, and the descent
passed with the rapidity of lightning, and in a
moment after the gallant train were gallopping to
the assistance of the falcon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their way lay along the high bank of the river,
from whose reedy margin the heron had been
roused. The path was often broken, and difficult
to traverse; but so eager were all to reach the
desired point that no one appeared to mind these
inequalities. Suddenly the path made an almost
precipitous descent, and while a portion of the
train dashed recklessly down the steep, the more
prudent checked their course, and sought a less
dangerous road. By this means the party became
divided, that which remained on the brow of the
hill being by far the more numerous. The other
group consisted, indeed, of but three individuals—a
falconer, a page, and the niece of their master, the
Earl of Torston. The palfrey of the latter was one
of rare speed, and it was with difficulty that the
two servitors could keep up with their beautiful and
high-spirited mistress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On Ralph—ay, Leoline, you are falling behind,”
she said, glancing around at her companions as the
distance between them rapidly increased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the right—to the right,” shouted the falconer,
“the heron has fallen in the marsh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maiden suddenly drew her rein in, to follow
this direction; but as she did so a half a score of
men, attired as Scottish borderers, started from the
thickets around, and seizing her bridle, and that of
her attendants, vanished with them into the recesses
of the forest. All efforts at resistance were precluded
by the numbers of the assailants, and lest
the two servitors should alarm their now rapidly
approaching companions, they were hastily gagged.
The whole party then set forward at a brisk pace
toward the neighboring Scottish border.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady Eleanor was one of the most beautiful
maidens of the north of England, and her expectations
from her childless uncle were equalled only by
her charms. Already had many a gallant knight
broken a lance in defence of her beauty, or sought
even more openly to win her for his bride. But to
all alike she bore the same demeanor. Her heart
was as yet untouched. Gay, sportive, full of wit,
and not altogether unconscious of her exalted station,
the heiress of three baronies continued to be
the idol of her uncle, and the admiration of the
English chivalry. It was while engaged in
hawking with her train that she had been surprised,
as we have related, by a band of Scottish
marauders, with the intention of profiting by her
ransom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some hours the party continued their flight
with unabated speed, concealing themselves in the
depths of the forests, until they had left the possessions
of Lord Torston, and gained a range of barren
and desolate hills, where there was little likelihood
of meeting with interruption. The object of the
capturers was obviously to bear off their prize
across the border, so rapidly as to defy all measures
to be taken for her rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady Eleanor was not, however, without
considerable energy of character, arising in part
no doubt from the stormy times in which she lived,
for she had listened so often to the tales of her
ancestor’s deeds that she felt it would derogate
from her, even though a maiden, not to shew a
portion of the same spirit in disaster. As they
were hurried along, therefore, she busied herself in
revolving a plan for her escape. But she could
think of no feasible scheme, without the co-operation
of her servitors, and they were kept so far in
the rear, and guarded so carefully, that any communication
with them she saw would be impossible.
In this perplexity she breathed a silent prayer to
the virgin, and was about resigning herself to her
fate when the wail of a bugle broke upon her ear,
and looking up she beheld three horsemen crossing
the brow of a hill, a few yards distant. At the
same moment the marauders recognised the new
comers as enemies, and hurrying their captives into
the rear prepared for the fray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! what have we here?” exclaimed the leader
of the men-at-arms, a bold stalwart youth, just verging
into manhood, turning to his companions, “by
St. George, a pack of Scottish thieves—and there
is a lady among them, a prisoner I trow, for she
is dressed like a maiden of rank. What say you,
comrades? we are three good men against yon
dozen varlets, shall we attempt a rescue?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay—ay—Harry Bowbent, lead on,” exclaimed
the leader of his companions, “for though your
blood is often over-hot, yet who could refuse to
charge yon Scottish knaves in such a cause?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The marauders had, meanwhile, drawn themselves
up across the road, and when the three men-at-arms
spurred their horses to the charge, the
Scots received them by stepping briskly aside, and
striking at the animals with their huge swords.
Two of the assailants were thus brought to the
ground at the first onset; but the one called Bowbent,
and his elder companion, bore each a Scotsman
to the earth with his long lance, and then
taking to their swords, struck about them with
such fury as to finish the contest in a space of time
almost as short as that which it takes to narrate it.
They did not, however, gain this victory without
cost. Both the youth and his elder comrade were
wounded, while the man-at-arms, who had been
unhorsed, was killed. Several of the marauders
fell on the field, and the others took to flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Jasper,” said the youth, looking mournfully
upon his slain follower, “your life was soon
ended. God help me! misfortunes seem to attend
on all who espouse my fortunes.” And, after regarding
the dead man a moment longer, the youth
turned away with a sigh, to fulfil his remaining
duty, by inquiring whom he had rescued, and offering
to conduct her to a place of safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the lady Eleanor had been an anxious
though admiring spectator of the contest, and many
a prayer did she breathe for the success of her gallant
rescuers. The boldness of the youth especially
aroused her interest, and her heart beat faster
and her breath came quicker, whenever he seemed
on the point of being overpowered. As he now
moved toward her, she felt, she knew not why, the
color mounting in her cheeks,—and as he raised
his visor, she could not but acknowledge that the
countenance beneath, vied with, and even excelled,
in manly beauty and frankness of expression, any
she had ever seen. The youth, however, had just
began to express, in the courtly language of the
day, his delight at having come up so opportunely,
when a sudden paleness shot over his countenance,
and after endeavoring vainly to speak, he sank,
fainting to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is only this ugly wound in his side,” said his
older comrade, noticing the alarm in the maiden’s
countenance, “he has fainted from loss of blood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can he not be borne to the castle?—here
Ralph, Leoline, a litter for the wounded man—but,
see, he revives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wounded youth opened his eyes faintly, and
gazed upon the maiden as she spoke, and then
closed them, as if in pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has fainted again,” said the lady Eleanor,
“cannot the blood be staunched? I have some
slight skill in the healing art, let me at least bind
up his wounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking a scarf from her neck as she spoke, the
maiden proceeded to examine the hurts of the young
man-at-arms, and having carefully bound them up,
during which operation the reviving sufferer testified
his mute gratitude by his looks, she allowed him to
be placed on the rude litter her servitors had hastily
prepared for him, and then the whole party set out
to return to the castle.</p>

<hr class='tbk108'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was a fortnight after the above events, and the
wounded youth was now convalescent. The room
in which he sat, was a large old gothic apartment,
but the mild breath of summer stealing through the
open window, and bearing the odor of flowers upon
its bosom, gave a freshness to that old chamber,
which banished, for the time, its gloominess. The
invalid was sitting up, and by his side was the lady
Eleanor, gazing up into his eyes with a look which
a woman bestows only upon the one she loves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On reaching the castle, the lady Eleanor, in the
absence of her uncle, ordered the utmost attentions
to be paid to the wounded young man. In consequence,
the best room in the castle was allotted to
him, and in the absence of a better leech, and in
compliance with the customs of the time, the lady
Eleanor herself became his physician. Opportunities
were thus presented for their being together,
which, as he grew more convalescent, became dangerous
to the peace of both. Perhaps it was his
dependence on her skill; perhaps it was the wound
he had received in her cause; perhaps it was that
she had expected no refinement whatever in one
apparently of such questionable rank; perhaps—but
no matter—like many a one before and since, it
was not long before the lady Eleanor found that in
attending her patient, she had lost her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was the wounded youth less inspired by
affection for his fair physician. Gratitude for her
kindness, to say nothing of her sweetness and
beauty, had long since won his most devoted love.
And, now, as they sat together, one might perceive,
by the heightened color on the cheek of the maiden,
and the unresisting manner in which her hand lay
in that of the youth, that their mutual affections had
just been revealed to each other in words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—sweet one,” said the youth, as if continuing
a conversation, “we may have much to overcome
before we triumph, if indeed we ever may;
and I almost wish that we had never met.” His
companion looked at him chidingly. “No, not
that either, dearest. But yet I would I could remove
this uncertainty that hangs around my birth.
I am at least a gentleman born—of that I have
always been assured—I am, moreover a knight;
but whether the son of a peer, or of one with only
a single fee, I know not. Until this uncertainty
can be removed, I cannot pretend openly to aspire
to your hand. I almost fear me that my honor
may be questioned, thus to plight my vows with
you, dear Eleanor; yet fate, which has thrown us
thus together, has some meaning in her freak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May it prove indeed so,” said the maiden.
“But you say you were always told you were noble
born. Who assured you of this? Indeed, I must
hear your history, for who knows,” continued she
archly, “but I may unravel your riddle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of my early life I know little, for though I
remember events as far back even as infancy, yet
it is but faintly, as we often remember incidents in a
dream. Indeed I have often thought that these
memories may be nothing more than vague recollections
of dreams themselves happening so far back
in my childhood as to seem like realities. Be that
as it may, I have these shadowy impressions of
living when very young in a large old castle, with
hosts of retainers, and being served as if I was the
owner of all. I remember also a fine noble looking
man, and a lovely lady who used to take me in her
arms and smile upon me. One day—it seems but
yesterday, and I remember this more distinctly than
any thing else—I was taken out by my attendants,
who were, I suspect, attacked and overpowered, for
I found myself rudely seized by a rough soldier, at
whom I cried, and by whom I was carried off. I
never saw any of my attendants more. Every face
around me was new, and for days I thought my
heart would break. I think I must have been
carried into Scotland, for as I grew up the country
around looked barren like it, and my protectors
were continually returning from forays over the
border on the Southron as they call us. Besides
even yet I have somewhat of their accent in my
speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could not have been but a very young child,
however, when I changed my protectors, and went
beyond sea. For two or three years we travelled
much; but finally settled in France. Those with
whom I resided were of the better sort of peasants,
and consisted of an old woman and her daughter.
We were often visited by a stern, dark man, whom
I was told was a knight. He indeed must have
been the person who was my real protector, for
after a while, my habitation was again changed,
and I became the resident of an old decayed fortalice,
where a warden and one or two servants constituted
the whole household. Here I remained
for many years, and until I was past my boyhood.
I saw no more of my imagined protector, but I
have every reason to believe he owned the old
castle, where, by-the-bye, I picked up some knowledge
of war-like-exercises; sufficient indeed to fit
me, at the age of eighteen, to be sent to the army
as a man-at-arms. I served a campaign under the
banner of the Sieur de Lorenge, to whom I had
been recommended by, I suppose, my unknown
protector. His secret agency I have no doubt was
exerted in procuring me to be knighted. Since
then I have been thrown upon my own resources,
and for a couple of years have served in Flanders,
but wishing to discover, if possible, my real birth, I
left the continent, and reaching England, set out on
this apparently insane search. I have been engaged
in it more than a half a year, and have yet obtained
no clue to my parentage. I judge it, however, to
be English, from my having been brought up in
Scotland, for I was certainly taken prisoner in a
foray. And now, dearest, you have my history—and
what, alas! do you know of me, except that I
am a penniless unknown knight, hunting through
this broad realm for a parentage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maiden did not answer the question of her
lover directly, but seemed lost in thought. She
gazed wonderingly upon the speaker, and said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange!—if it should prove to be so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wondering at her inexplicable question, her lover
said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is strange, dearest?” But scarcely had
this inquiry been made, when a servant appeared,
informing the lovers, that the uncle of the lady
Eleanor had arrived unexpectedly from court, and
begged at once to be allowed to pay his thanks to
the brave knight who had rescued his niece.</p>

<hr class='tbk109'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was a fortnight later in our history. A small
cavalcade was winding along a romantic road, late
in the afternoon. At its front rode two knights,
completely armed, except as to their heads, which
were covered with light caps, instead of helmets.
A palfrey, upon which rode a lady, and the numerous
handmaidens in the group, showed the cavalcade
to be that of a woman of rank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the procession reached the brow of a
hill, overlooking a wide reach of pasture and woodland.
An extensive valley stretched below, through
which meandered a stream, that now glittered in
the sunlight, and was now lost to sight as it entered
the mazes of the forest. In the very centre of the
valley, and on a gentle elevation, stood a large and
extensive castle, its defences reaching completely
around the low hill upon which it stood. As the
prospect broke upon the sight, the two knights drew
in their reins, and the elder turning to the younger
one, whom the reader will instantly recognise as
the hero of our tale, said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yonder is Torston castle, and in less than an
hour we shall be within its walls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a noble fortress it is, my lord. I have
seen many both in this fair realm and in France,
but few to equal yon proud castle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The landscape is itself a fine one,” said Lord
Torston, “though few of our profession of arms
have an eye for beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The rudest boor, my lord, could not fail to
admire this scene. And yet it does not seem
wholly new to me. I have an indistinct impression
of having beheld something like it before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps, in some fair valley of France. But
we must push on, or we shall not reach the castle
until nightfall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A brisker pace, however, soon brought the cavalcade
to the outskirts of the domain. Descending
the hill, they passed amid verdant woods and open
lawns, and villages scattered here and there, until
they readied the immediate vicinity of the castle,
and in a few minutes more they entered the large
gateway, and drew up in the court-yard. Every
thing around seemed to recall to the mind of the
young knight some long forgotten dream; and
when alighting, they entered the hall, with its raised
table at the upper end and the large antlers surmounting
the dais, it appeared to him as if he had
returned to some favorite place on which he had
been wont to gaze in days long gone by. Suddenly
he paused, looked eagerly around, placed his hand
to his brow, and said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord, this is strange. It seems to me as if
I knew this place, and every step only reveals some
old remembered feature to me. It cannot be that I
have dreamed of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Sir Henry, you have not. You have seen
it, but long ago. I have suspected this for some
days, but I am now convinced.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord,” said the young knight with a bewildered
air, “what mean you? It cannot be, and
yet your words, your looks, your gestures, imply it—am
I to find in this castle my birth-place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! my son,” exclaimed the baron, unable
longer to control the emotions, which had been
swelling for days in his bosom, “and in me you
find a father,” and opening his arms, his long lost
son fell into his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I no sooner saw your face,” said the father,
when these emotions had subsided sufficiently to
permit an explanation, “than I felt a yearning towards
you, for it reminded me of your mother. But
when I heard your story,” he continued, “it tallied
so completely with the loss of my only son, that I
suspected at once that you were my child. Your
age, too, agreed with what his should have been.
Unwilling, however, to make known my belief, I
enjoined silence on my niece, determining to bring
you here in order to see if the sight of your birth-place
would awaken old recollections in your bosom.
I have succeeded. I do not doubt but that
you are my son,—and now let me lead you to your
cousin, who by this time will have changed her apparel,
and be ready to receive us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One moment, only,” said Sir Henry, “I have
that here, which as yet I have shewn to no one. It
is a ring I wore on my neck when a child. Here
it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God be praised, my son,” said the old baron,
“for removing every doubt. This is your mother’s
wedding ring, which, after her death, you wore
around your neck,” and the long-separated father
and son again embraced, while tears of joy and
thankfulness stole down the old man’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is it to be supposed that the lady Eleanor looked
more coldly on her lover, now that every difficulty
in the way of their union was removed: or that the
young heir was less eager to possess himself of his
bride, because, by wedding her, he would preserve
to her the possessions which otherwise she would
lose? Truth compels us to answer both questions
in the negative. Scarcely a month had elapsed
before the young knight led his blooming cousin to
the altar, while his new-found father looked on with
a joy which he had thought, as a childless man, he
could never more have experienced. And in the
proud array of England’s proudest chivalry, which
met at Torston castle to celebrate the nuptials, no
one demeaned himself more gallantly, or won more
triumphs in the lists, than the young knight, now
no longer Harry Bowbent, the soldier of fortune,
but the heir of the richest earldom in the realm.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-weight:bold;'>WRITTEN FROM DAMASCUS, BY SERVILIUS PRISCUS OF CONSTANTINOPLE, TO HIS KINSMAN, CORNELIUS DRUSUS, RESIDING AT ATHENS, AND BUT NOW TRANSLATED.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-bottom:1em;'>Damascus.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:2em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Servilius to Cornelius—Greeting</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>I hope</span> you will not deem me tedious, my friend,
if I endeavor to describe to you the manner in which
Lactantius maintained the truth of that faith of
which he is one of the most illustrious advocates.
But you should have heard him, to have felt yourself
in the presence of one of the greatest of men. As
the day was mild, Septimus ordered the couches to
be disposed along the level roof, as affording much
the most delightful place to hold a conversation,
for so harmless is the air of this climate, that you
may even take your midnight repose under the
open sky; and this they inform us is the reason
why this land is so noted for those who are skilled
in the map of the heavens. This, you may truly
say, should be no matter of surprise, for it may be
held impossible that one the least inclined to meditation
should behold, night after night, without being
fired with the spirit of investigation, that overspreading
canopy unbounded and far reaching as eternity,
but bright with wheeling stars, that rise at their
own fixed moment, and set behind some well-known
peak, and thus, year after year, traverse the same
unvarying and harmonious circle, without collision
with their sister orbs—glorious and imperishable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun, last sinking toward Cyprus, robbed of
his exhausting heats, was mildly burning above
Lebanon. The city lay on every side. In one
direction rose the pillar of Antonine; in another
the amphitheatre; and you might, with steady observation,
see the wild beasts pacing to and fro,
with impatient step, their well-barred cages, kept
now more for curiosity than sport. In another
quarter the accustomed grove relieved the wilderness
of marble, like a clump of palms which often
starts out so refreshingly against the whitened sands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, what was most beautiful to behold from this
elevated site, was the far receding valley in which
this city is built, sheltered on either hand by an
eternal battlement of rocks, cultivated to the utmost
stretch of industry, clothed with its fruitful vines,
and glistening with its hundred gardens, temples
and villas, wherever you might look. Through its
centre ran the mazy Leontes, shining from among
its tufted banks, and catching ever and anon the
parting glories of the sun while on its bosom, or
suddenly emerging from some green shade, the eye
detected, by the sparkling of the oar, the gaily
colored galley, freighted with many a light heart.
Thus raised above the bustle of the crowded
thoroughfares, and soothed by the Cyprian breeze,
we felt the inspiring influence of all we saw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lactantius was the first to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hesitate not to avow,” said he, “that I feel
a deep solicitude in behalf of my friend Mobilius.
Would that I had the power to expound to him the
unsatisfactory reliance of his faith, the feebleness
of its supports, and the terms of its delusions. As
the shivering reed trembles on the first assault of
the rude wind, so does this perishable belief upon
the first advance of swift-footed adversity; forsaking
you when you most require the aid of ready guidance
and bright-eyed consolation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brought from Egypt by the crafty priest, that
land of science, but of superstition, he planted it in
a soil where he was certain it would thrive, and
to make success more sure he mingled with it the
gaudy ceremonies of Chaldea. Strange that so
noxious a plant should flourish as well as in its
native soil, and so near the walls of Bethlehem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They burn an offering of perpetual fires to the
king of day—what a sorry imitation of his light
when but a struggling ray shall quench it! They
behold his blinding brightness, they feel his piercing
heats, they see nature bloom beneath his smiles,
and they forget he sprang from something. They
look not beyond. Will the sun rescue us from
affliction, and heal us in the hour of sickness?
How,” he exclaimed, warming as he spoke, and
felt the influence of rapt attention—“How shall
glittering rites propitiate that which can neither
feel nor see, which was created to rule the day,
divide the light from darkness, and mark the rolling
seasons, but has no power to save, to heal or vanquish?
The throbbing pulse, the glistening eye, the
kindly sympathy we feel in another’s anguish speaks
to us of a soul, declares to us we sprang from some
sublime and all wise original. Behold,” said he,
rising from his couch with a commanding attitude,
“yon temple, the boast of Syria, what symmetry,
what grandeur!—as wise would it be to say it sprang
from nothing, as that sun, which from time almost
incalculable, has risen in the east and set beneath
those mountains. It must have been the instrument
of an all wise purpose. Then why not adore
the source through whose command it blazed into
existence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is it, Mobilius, that the faithful follower
in our faith, worn out by agonising pain, or hastening,
hour after hour, toward certain dissolution,
every thing, the bright skies, the anxious faces of
those that gather round him, exposing to his fading
eye—how is it he is yet more cheerful as his shattered
frame sinks into increasing weakness—so
that neither the stake, with its tortures, the amphitheatre,
with its jeers and cruel glances, nor the
silent chamber, where the last enemy of the good
man approaches with slower step, and where he
does not find the support or triumph of a martyrdom,
shall shake his confidence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Mobilius seemed oppressed with affliction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, my good friend,” said Lactantius,
“that grieves you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will tell you: your words shoot anguish
through my soul, but it is for memories that are
past. My sister, she on whom I lavished every
thought, and all that I possessed, was snatched
from me in the midst of mutual happiness. She
lingered, and was buoyed up by some sweet and
hidden consolation she appeared anxious to impart,
but the flickering flame of life burnt too feebly in
the lamp. It was, it must have been this; would I
had known it, that I might have whispered into her
ear I knew it. Her last look was cast upon the
blue depths of heaven, as if in earnest contemplation
of some glorious spectacle, and she died with
a sweet smile upon her features, as if listening to
sweet music. ‘Mobilius,’ she said, pointing upward,
‘Mobilius, my dear brother, behold the—’
but the trembling syllables died into a whisper—she
had fled! There were to me sweet smiles no
longer to cheer the vigor of my desolation—I was
alone in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Console yourself,” replied Lactantius, “this
was an evidence your sister died in peace. Trouble
not yourself on this account, you may meet her
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this communication his countenance, dull and
heavy with grief, brightened as the sun through
showers. You have seen a piece of marble carved
into a coarse resemblance of the face. You have
come again. The chisel of a master spirit has
been busy in its god-like lineaments. It almost
speaks; the dull, cold marble almost warms into a
smile—such was the change. Mobilius, gathering
his mantle about him, abruptly left us, nor did I see
him again throughout that day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stars began to glimmer as the sunlight
waned, and we felt in all its bounteous fulness the
care-dispelling influence of this clime. The conversation
was prolonged, and I found that Lactantius
was as well skilled in the policy of existing
governments, as in the peculiarities of all the prevailing
theologies, in short, as competent for the
duties of a statesman as a bishop; and it grieves
me not a little that so many should be raised to
this eminent station in the church so far inferior to
Lactantius, while he, blessed with every natural
gift, endowed with the quickest of intellects—enriched
with all the learning—polished, fiery and
overwhelming in speech, or if it please him, mild
and winning as the softest Lydian measure, the
Christian and the philosopher, should be thrust aside.
This age will be signalised upon the page of the
historian, as much because it gave birth to a Constantine
as that on it there flourished a Lactantius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now descended, and the evening passed in
the enjoyments of those rational pleasures which
are always sought with an increasing relish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To turn to another topic, shall I propose a subject
for thy solution? What is that which may be
likened to the gleam that struggles through the
dark and overhanging mists, driving away in its
scattering brightness the gloom of the weeping
clouds? Yes, and I have known it prove stronger
than the precepts of philosophy, or the examples of
heroic ardor, kindling dying courage, inspiring god-like
resolution, and confessing a manly port and
look which seemed to herald victory ere it was
achieved. More enlivening than the wine of Chios,
let it but beam upon you, and the mist of bewilderment
flies, and in its place you find that joy the
poets so sweetly picture. What is it, you say, has
induced Servilius to wander from the thread of his
narrative? Of a certainty you cannot hesitate a moment—a
woman’s smile! You whisper the boy
Cupid, and that no other than one assailed by his
dart, could invest with such rosy hues that which
one sees and feels every hour of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But let me pause. I am writing to a philosopher,
and one who may chide me when he remembers
the discussions we have had upon this matter, and
in which I took the sterner part. But I recant, I
renounce my errors. You have influence, Cornelius,
at Athens. Place the good of all that is left to us
below upon a loftier pedestal. Woman should be
looked up to with admiration, and not down upon
with contempt. What, as yourself must admit, so
softens the rigors of existence as the winning influence
of woman, and why should they be treated
as so insignificant a portion of the state? Be persuaded
that that nation, which by its laws most
elevates the character of woman, which pays the
most profound obeisance to their gentle virtues, is
nearest the standard of true happiness, and surest
in the certainty of its duration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These were my reflections, when who other
should approach, as wearied and heated from exposure
to the sun, I had thrown myself upon a couch
beside a fountain in the hall of Septimus, both unperceiving
and unperceived until too late to retreat,
than Placidia and Lucretia. They seemed to hesitate
and blush, but instantly arising, I invited them
to stay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You came, I know, to seek the coolness of
this airy hall, and you must permit me to retire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” they exclaimed, “that we must not do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look wearied,” Lucretia added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I have been pacing the crowded streets
of this proud city in search of amusement and instruction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is it?” she asked, “that you youth of
Rome who travel, take such pleasure in beholding
a pile of marble variously disposed. Having seen
one handsome temple, I am sure all the rest are
like it, though perchance they may be somewhat
larger or smaller, or have an additional column or
so. Is it a taste which is natural or does it come
of cultivation?” and thus she dashed on in the
same gay strain, as if undetermined whether to
speak with lightness or with seriousness. Placidia
now began a skilful attack upon my adversary, nor
could the best disciple of the schools have made a
more effectual sally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was but yesterday, Lucretia, I heard you
discourse so prettily about the great buildings in the
city, with choice of language, and glow of thought
that any poet might have envied. There were the
flowery capitals—the happy arrangement—the beautiful
designs—the—but I cannot remember the
learned phrases which you used. I have it—you
spoke but to draw our friend into an argument,
in order that he might show wherein you are in
error.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucretia stood silent, half-smiling, half-angry, as
if to say, tarry until a more fitting opportunity—wait
until we are alone my sweet Placidia, and I
will amply revenge myself for these unreserved
communications.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must acknowledge, Placidia,” I replied, “the
kindness of your interposition. But the inquiry of
Lucretia has been fully answered by the unfortunate
Longinus, a copy of whose immortal works I have
now in my possessions, and it would be a source
of pleasure to study them with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We embrace the proposition with delight,” she
answered, but then, as if fearing she had been too
eager, she replied, “but Mobilius must be of the
number.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Placidia,” said Lucretia, “do you know then
that Septimus and all his friends are alarmed at the
absence of Mobilius: he has not been seen since
he left us last night?” This was uttered in a tone
which led me to believe her previous gaiety was
but assumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it possible?” replied Placidia with emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must go and assist my friends in their search,”
I replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you are not acquainted with the streets of
Heliopolis, and what service could you render?”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friendship, Placidia—” but she interrupted me
as if in anticipation of what I was about to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go—hasten,” at the same time whispering in
my ear as she turned, and deeply blushing, “let me
see you on your return—I have something to confide
to you which hangs heavily upon my spirits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see how it is,” and the fire of jealousy shot
through my veins, “she loves Mobilius;” but such
ungenerous thoughts were soon driven from my
mind, when I remembered the uncertainty of the
fate of my friend. At this moment I heard the
name of Septimus cried aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is Septimus?” exclaimed one of the
slaves as he rushed into the hall; “a lion has escaped
from the amphitheatre—” he said, and trembled
with fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And has been chasing you, or you are frightened,”
I replied. “Why hesitate? the door is
closed.” He looked up, as if imploring my patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Worse, worse,—Mobilius was found on the
road that leads to the temple of Venus, upon Lebanon,
mangled,—” here he was completely overpowered.
Indeed, it was dreadful news, and I
asked the man no further questions. Placidia sank
senseless upon a couch, while Lucretia, greatly
affected, endeavored to support her tottering frame.
As soon as she was partially restored, I departed,
and meeting Lactantius, who had been more active
in his enquiries, he cheered me by a most agreeable
piece of news, as compared with the hopeless story
I had heard. It was only the mantle of Mobilius
that had been found, and there was no blood upon
it. I hastened to relieve the anxieties of my
friends, and was ushered into the presence of Placidia,
by her maid, who stood waiting for me under
the portico.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hastily told her what I had heard. After expressing
her joy, she broke to me her story. “Servilius,
my friend, for you must permit me to call
you such, from your many acts of kindness I shall
never be able to repay—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>You</span> cannot <span class='it'>repay</span>,” I whispered to myself,
“oh! cruel Placidia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is something, which greatly troubles me,
and some hidden prompter seems to tell me that by
unburdening to you the cause of my sorrow, I shall
find the speediest relief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My heart now beat high with expectation, “dare
I hope?” I said to myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It cannot be a dream,” she said, with her eyes
fixed, and half-musing, as if for the moment unconscious
of my presence. “It cannot be a dream—but
I no sooner beheld the face of Mobilius, than
the recollection of youth rushed upon my memory,
and I thought of my brother and my sister, who
have long slept with the perished. They were
wrecked upon the coast of Africa, and none escaped
to bear to mourning friends the brief story of their
fate, but one, who, floating on a fragment of the
vessel, was taken up as he was on the point of
relinquishing his hold, from utter weakness, by a
Syrian galley. Messengers were despatched, and
my uncle himself undertook the risk and toil of a
journey on our behalf. But all was in vain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is still an expectation to be cherished,” I
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you give hope?” said she, faintly smiling
through her tears, “affection once clung to the
feeblest support, but it has long since despaired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shall not despair,” I answered, with an
energy that startled, her, hurrying out of the apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I soon recollected myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have I done?” I thought, “years have
rolled by, nor could I flatter myself with the hope
of success even if I wandered over all the territory
of Rome, and ventured to the unknown land of the
barbarian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now remembered that I had heard Apicius
speak of some wealthy merchant residing in Berytus,
who owned many galleys in communicating
with the coast of Africa, but he had gone to his
villa, and I was obliged to postpone my investigation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Returning to the hall, I met Septimus, who told
me the last that had been heard of Mobilius was
from a Syrian merchant, who knew and accosted
him hastening toward the road leading to the
mountains, but with his eye riveted upon the path.
He advanced with rapid strides. I then told Septimus
the news his slave had brought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! there is no longer a doubt, Servilius,” he
replied, “since this is the same road on which the
temple stands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We parted in grief, and Septimus in despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When first I met Mobilius there was a levity in
his manner which did not please me, but since his
conversations with Lactantius a noted change had
been wrought in him, and the hidden virtues of his
character shone unclouded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We did not meet until we mingled at the evening
tables; but no joy was there, and the silence was
only broken by a loud cry from the slaves, as if
something unusual had taken place. Septimus
arose to ascertain the cause, when he was suddenly
confronted by Mobilius, with dishevelled hair and
robes. A shriek of surprise and joy burst from
every tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We greet you, my dear Mobilius,” said Sergius,
as he pressed his hand with parental fondness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mobilius cast upon him a look of wonder, blended
with bewilderment, as if in the sudden but vain
effort to recall some long effaced recollection, or it
might have been from gratitude at the interest of a
stranger in a stranger’s fate. All with one accord
begged him to tell the cause of his absence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you would feel solicitude,” he said,
“and as you perceive by the dust upon my robe, I
have hastened to relieve your anxieties. The conversation
of last night, and the light that suddenly
broke upon my soul, for the while robbed me of my
senses. I hurried from you, nor did I stop until I
left the city many a pace behind me. Midnight
gathered on. I began to recollect myself and
sought shelter at the temple which lay in my way.
I struck its gate with redoubling blows. I cried
aloud, but none answered. Verily you might perish
before these cruel priests would give you protection.
A lofty tree presented the only refuge. Awakened
by the morning sun, and descending, I retraced my
steps with as much anxiety to reach Heliopolis as I
had felt to leave it. I had not gone far, however,
when to my horror I encountered that terrible lion
of the amphitheatre. Subterfuge and presence of
mind afforded the only chance of safety. Escape
was impossible, and weapon I had none. He fixed
his fiery eye upon me, lashed his tail, as if sure of
his prey, and crouched to spring. Now was the
only hope. Hastily unloosening my light robe, I
suddenly raised it upon a slender stick, torn from a
neighboring bush, and quickly stepped aside. The
deceit was successful, the furious animal sprang at
it, dragged it on the ground, and tore it into atoms.
Rushing toward a tree, while I left him at the
garment, I mounted among its branches as with
wings. I do assure you I never climbed with more
alacrity. The noble animal, discovering his mistake,
scowled with sullen fierceness toward my
place of shelter, and seemingly satisfied with the
vengeance he had taken, strode onward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A most fortunate escape,” ejaculated Valerius;
“you must present your gifts to-morrow at the
temple.” A tear twinkled in the eye of Lactantius,
and I fancied I saw his lips move as in the act of
prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Valerius, and it is not the first escape with
which a guardian Providence has blessed me. Shipwreck
and slavery I also have escaped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shipwreck,” enquired Sergius, with anxiety,
“will you tell us the sad story? I had a son who
was shipwrecked,” and the old man trembled in the
effort to subdue his grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will. I left Rome on a voyage to Athens;
we were driven by stress of weather into a port of
Sicily. The storm abating, we pursued our course
along the coast of Africa, being obliged to touch at
Alexandria, but we were wrecked before we reached
our haven, and nearly all the crew were swallowed
by the waves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me for asking,” said Marcus, “but did
you not write to Rome, after you secured your
liberty, to discover whether your kindred were still
living?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wrote many epistles, and to my uncle also,
who told me they were all carried off by a terrible
pestilence, which visited the city, and that my patrimony
had been previously confiscated to the state,
because of some act of my parent, and that if I
ventured to Rome the rage of my father’s enemies
would doubtless be turned against me. I had no
wish, however, to undertake the voyage, since those
most cherished were no more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what was the name of your father?” asked
Lactantius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucius Sergius.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The venerable man paused for a moment in
mute bewilderment, and then rushed into the arms
of Mobilius, exclaiming, “Caius, my son, my long
lost son!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My sisters,” he cried, as they ran to embrace
their beloved brother, and wept with joy. It was a
touching scene, and the ecstacy of gladness brightened
every face. Here let me drop the veil with
the promise of ending the description of the trials
and fortunes of my friend in my next epistle.</p>

<div><h1><a id='clot'></a>THE CLOTHING OF THE ANCIENTS.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY WILLIAM DUANE, JR.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>If</span> the ancient inhabitants of the world had
extreme difficulty in sheltering themselves from
the severity of the seasons, they experienced much
more in giving to their clothes the impress of art
or industry. Consult Strabo; he will tell you that
certain nations covered themselves with the bark
of trees, fig-leaves or rushes, rudely intertwined.
Often also the skins of animals were employed,
without the least preparation, for the same end.
In proportion as the barbarism disappeared which
had been introduced by the confusion of tongues,
they began to think of the wool of sheep, and to
ask themselves if there were no means of uniting in
a single thread the different pieces of this substance
by the aid of a kind of spindle. Seeing their efforts
crowned with success, “Let us now,” said they,
“try to imitate the spider.” They did so; and,
behold, as Democritus begs us to observe, the art
of weaving invented! After that, the invariable
custom which existed among the Jews, fifteen
hundred years before Jesus Christ, of collecting
the fleeces of their sheep at fixed periods; and
great was the account which they made of it
according to the testimony of Genesis (31, 19.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The history, true or fabulous, of the web of
Penelope, the wife of Ulysses, proves to us that
wool was not the sole material to which they
thought of applying the art of weaving. And do
we not read in Pliny that “the cotton plant grew
in Upper Egypt, that they made stuffs of it, and
that the Egyptian priests made admirable surplices
of it?” It is undeniable that garments of cotton
and of linen were in use in the time of the patriachs;
indeed Moses commands his people in the 22d
chapter of Deuteronomy, “not to wear a dress of
linen;” and the ancient Babylonians, as Herodotus
informs us, (Book I.) “wore immediately over their
skin a cambric tunic, which fell down to their feet
in the oriental manner.” It was the same among
the Athenians, according to Thucydides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the age of Augustus, many people had already
arrived at great perfection in the manufacture of
linen stuffs: it is the express assertion of the historian
Pliny. “The Faventine cloth,” says he, “is
always whiter than the Allienne cloth. That which
they have designated by the word <span class='it'>Retovine</span>, is so
exceedingly fine that its threads are as slender as
those of the spider. I have myself seen a thread
of Cumes hemp so thin that a great net made of
this material could go through a common ring; and
I have heard tell of a man who could carry on his
back as much as was required to encircle an entire
forest. The fine cambric, made of the linen of
Byssus, is a product of Achaia; it was sold in old
times for its weight in gold.” (Book 19.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Egyptian Museum of the Royal Library
of Paris, you may cast your eyes upon mummies,
found in the catacombs of Cairo: the cloth in
which they are wrapped is not at all coarser than
the cambric of your shops; and yet it has been
woven three hundred years. On this occasion it is
not inappropriate to add that the art of weaving is
still more ancient than that of embalming; which
this answer of Abraham to the king of Sodom
indicates: “I will not carry away a single thread
of your wool,” said the patriarch to him, “lest you
should say—I have made Abraham rich!” Elsewhere,
Moses informs us that Abimelech presented
a veil to Sarah; that on the approach of Isaac,
Rebecca covered her face with a veil; and that
when Joseph was appointed viceroy of Egypt,
Prince Pharaoh covered him with a linen robe
after having placed his own ring upon his finger.
The Book of Job (the most ancient writing perhaps
in existence) mentions a weaver’s <span class='it'>shuttle</span>, (chapter
7.) A thousand years before the Christian era, do
you see, setting out along the desert, those messengers
of the wise Solomon, going to procure in
Egypt cloths of fine linen for the king, their master?
Shortly after, the city of Tyre obtained great celebrity
for the beauty of its fine linens; and Ezekiel
dwells enraptured on the opulence of its merchants
in the following terms:—“All the planks of thy
vessels are of the fine fir tree of Senir, and their
masts are of the cedar of Lebanon! For their
sails thou hast employed the fine linen of Egypt,
splendidly embroidered.” Do not suppose that all
the sails of this period were of as precious a material
as those of the Tyrians: like those of the
Arabians of our days, they were generally composed
of woven rushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The women commonly wore white dresses; besides,
the ancients had early made rapid progress
in the art of bleaching. They were all ignorant,
as you may well suppose, of the expeditious process
which the illustrious Berthollet has conceived, with
the assistance of a hydrochlorate of lime or of
soda; they knew, however, how to use other
detersive substances to impart a shining whiteness
to their stuffs. “There exists among us,” says
Pliny, “a species of poppy, very rare, which bleaches
linen cloth wonderfully; and yet, would one believe
it? we have among us a crowd of people so vain
that they have attempted to dye their linen as well
as their wool.” In alluding in another passage to
the sky-blue curtains of the Emperor Nero, he begs
us not to forget that, despite of all the rich shades
produced by dyeing, <span class='it'>white</span> cloth never ceased to
enjoy the highest reputation, to such a degree that
they conferred the title of <span class='it'>Great</span> on a person named
<span class='it'>Lentulus Spinter</span>, who first conceived the idea of
hanging white curtains around the places consecrated
to the Olympic games. This same kind of
stuff was spread upon all the houses of the <span class='it'>Via
Sacra</span>, by order of Cæsar, the Dictator, who planning
magnificent decorations, wished that they
should extend from his residence up to the Capitol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The basis of the hard soap of our days was undoubtedly
known to the ancients. The <span class='it'>natron</span> or
sub-carbonate of soda, which they collect in the
channels of the Nile at the present time, was really
gathered there in sufficient abundance in the first
ages of the world. From another place, the man
of Uz made use of it; for he makes ready in
one of his chapters (Job, ch. 9.) to wash his clothes
in a pit with <span class='it'>bor</span> or <span class='it'>borith</span>, a plant much esteemed
on account of its alkaline properties. (You must
not confound this with the <span class='it'>boron</span> of modern chemistry,
which with oxygen constitutes the boracic
acid.) Open the Sixth Book of the Odyssey;
Homer will there shew you Nausicaa, and her
companions, trampling their clothes with their feet
to whiten them for an approaching marriage; the
bard adds that the ladies knew perfectly well the
property which the atmosphere possessed of assisting
in the destruction of the only substance which
imparts a greyish appearance to cloths. In alluding
to this passage, Goguet affirms that all the linen
and cotton garments were washed daily. An anecdote
related by Apuleius in his book of “The Golden
Ass,” goes to prove still more the attention which
they formerly paid to the art of bleaching; “A
wag,” said he to us, “being secretly introduced
into the house of a merchant, came near being
suffocated by the sulphurous gas which was given
out by a bleaching machine in which he was hid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ability of the ancients to bestow upon their
linen, cotton<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> and woolen cloths a brightness not
inferior to that of the snow of their mountains, did
not fail them when they had to dye them. More
than three thousand years ago a cunning shrew,
as Genesis informs us, (ch. 28.) fastened a scarlet
ribbon around the hand of one of the children of
Tamar: and Homer speaks to us in the part of his
poem above mentioned, of the colored cloths of
Sidon as admirable productions. Jacob made for
his beloved son Joseph, “a robe of many colors,”
and the king of Tyre sent into the palace of Solomon
“a man skilful to work wonderfully in gold,
silver, &amp;c. and to produce upon fine linen the
shades of purple, blue and crimson.” According
to Herodotus, who wrote, as you know, four hundred
years before Jesus Christ, some people of
Caucasus washed in water the leaves of a certain
tree, which yielded at length a brilliant color, with
the aid of which they drew upon stuffs the figures
of lions, monkeys, dolphins and vultures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the brave knights who perished at
Colchis, in the Argonautic expedition, there was
one whom the historian Valerius Flaccus distinguishes
by his painted tunic, at the same time that
he expresses his admiration of the whiteness of the
fine cloth which the hero also wore:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Tenuia non illum <span class='it'>candentis</span> carbossa lini,</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Speaking of Colchis, it was there that the best
materials for painting were formerly procured.
Besides, if you will ascend in spirit to the days
of old, you will perceive every year on the roads
leading from Georgia to the principal cities of
India, as well as to Dimbeck, an immense drove
of two thousand camels, loaded with madder.
Thence the <span class='it'>red</span><a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> flowers were derived, of which
Strabo speaks, which the nations dwelling on the
borders of the Indus and the Ganges loved to
spread upon their cloths. It is a particular worthy
of remark that the Egyptians who constantly
clothed the statues of their goddess Isis with <span class='it'>linen</span>
and <span class='it'>cotton</span> drapery, never employed <span class='it'>wool</span> for that
purpose, a substance which they hated so much
that they did not permit the use of it, even in interments,
as the 44th chapter of Ezekiel informs us.
This aversion extended even to shepherds, for you
may read in Genesis that every shepherd was an
abomination to the Egyptians. (46.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The purple of Tyre was known at an epoch
exceedingly remote, and the dyers of Phœnicia surpassed
in skill those of all the other nations of the
east. This people came a thousand years ago as
far as Great Britain to procure an enormous quantity
of tin, a metal which has the property, or rather
certain salts of it have, of augmenting the intensity
of the principal red colors contained in many vegetable
and animal substances. Upon this subject, we
would advise you to run over, in the third book of
Strabo, the interesting recital which he gives of the
pursuit of a Phœnician vessel by a Roman bark,
which wished to seize the tin with which it was
freighted. It was in the neighborhood of the coast
of Cornwall: the Phœnician, seeing the prow of the
Roman near his stern, threw three-fourths of his
cargo overboard, and steered right upon a sand-bank,
where the enemy, as you may well suppose,
did not think of following him. The Tyrians,
astonished at the great opulence which their city
attained, attributed to the gods the magic art of
dyeing in purple. All writers, and especially
Ctesias, physician to a king of Persia, who lived
four hundred years before the Christian era, and
Ælian, a contemporary of Alexander Severus, frequently
allude to an insect, to which the Phœnicians
were indebted for the superior manner in
which they could produce an admirable scarlet. It
was evidently the cochineal: and this little animal
must have been at that time less rare than at present
in Syria, India, and Persia, since the humblest
classes frequently wore stuffs dyed with purple. It
is not surprising that they knew not how to extract
from the cochineal the most brilliant of all the
known reds, the carmine, before which the vermillion
grows pale, and which chemistry can procure
for us, in our days, in great abundance; and you
know that this little insect lives upon the <span class='it'>cactus</span>
which grow in Brazil, in Mexico, at Jamaica, and
at Saint Domingo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fashion of wearing silk was unknown at
Rome, before the beginning of the empire. The
rage for dressing in it was already so great in the
time of Tiberius, that the emperor prohibited the
use of it by a positive law. The Greeks also had
a taste for it; and the cloak of <span class='it'>Amphion</span> was certainly
of silk, for the historian Philostratus (Ion,
Book I.) tells us that its color changed according
to the different ways in which the light was reflected
from it. Pliny gives us to understand that the gold
stuffs of the ancients were not made as those of
our time, of a thread of gold or silver, wrapped
around a woof of silk, but that they were woven of
gold deprived of all alloy: knowing this, he speaks
of the manner in which the wife of Claudius dressed
herself to attend a <span class='it'>Naumachia</span> or sea fight, in
the following terms—“Nos vidimus Agrippinam—indutam
palludamento auro textile, <span class='it'>sine alia materia</span>.”
It is about fifty years since they extracted,
by assaying, more than four pounds weight of pure
gold from some old dresses which the fathers of
the Clementine College, at Rome, discovered in an
urn of basalt, buried in their vineyard. Tarquin,
the Elder, was he, among the Roman Sovereigns
who most usually wore dresses of gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the time of Homer the Greeks wore <span class='it'>black</span>
dresses for mourning. This bard shews us Thetis
wearing, after the death of Patroclus, the blackest
of her dresses. (Iliad, 24.) For many years the
same usage prevailed among the Romans, but it
was partly changed under the emperors, so that
when Plutarch wrote, the women in mourning
could wear nothing but white. Besides, we have
a proof of it at the obsequies of Septimius Severus:
“The image of this emperor,” Herodian tells us,
“formed of wax, was surrounded on one side by a
row of women in <span class='it'>white</span>, and on the other by the
body of all the senators, clothed in <span class='it'>black</span>. At the
death of the Empress Plotina,” adds the historian,
“her husband Trajan covered himself with very
black habits for the space of nine days.” The
<span class='it'>toga</span> necessarily received as many shades of color
as the other garments: but as to the form of this
kind of robe it is impossible to decide. When
Dionysius, of Halicarnassus, asserts that the toga
presented the appearance of a semicircle (’ημικυκλος)
he did not at all intend to describe its shape, but
only the form which it assumed when worn upon
the body. Strabo asserts that the military cloak
with which the warriors clothed themselves had an
oval form; and that among the Athenians it was
often worn by the young people even in time of
peace. The <span class='it'>tunic</span>, which was the principal part
of the under clothing, was not generally used
among the nations of antiquity, except the Greeks
and Romans; all the Cynic philosophers disdained
to make use of it. We know that Augustus put
on as many as four tunics in winter. The name
of this great emperor reminds us that it was in his
reign, or thereabouts, that the Romans began to
use table-cloths. Montfaucon believes that the
greater part of them were of cloth striped with
gold and purple. In France the ancient table-cloths
were intended for collecting, after the meal,
the smallest crumbs that were left, that nothing
might be lost; and D’Arcy informs you that among
our neighbors, the English, table linen was very
seldom used in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As there exist in our days many nations, especially
in the torrid zone, who do not wear <span class='it'>hats</span>,
(a name by which we must understand every covering
for the head, as its etymology plainly indicates,)
so it formerly happened that the nations did not
always think of making use of them. Thus one of
the most civilized, the Egyptians, went bare-headed,
according to the authority of Hesiod. Amongst
the Orientals, and especially amongst the Persians,
the turban was in great vogue; that of the sovereign
was composed of a whole bale of muslin. It was
from this last mentioned people that the Jews derived
the turban. The hats of the Greeks must
have had very large brims, to judge from the root
of the word (πετασος) which designated them. The
Romans granted to their freedmen the right of
covering themselves with a kind of cap, which has
been since adopted as the emblem of liberty. It is
to a Swiss, residing in Paris, about the beginning
of the fifteenth century, that we owe the first invention
of felt hats. They were generally known
at the close of the reign of Charles VII.: this
monarch himself wore one at his triumphal entry
into Rouen, in 1449. We read in Daniel that the
worthy townsmen of that ancient city stood still
as if petrified, so much were they astonished at
seeing his majesty’s hat; the historian adds that its
lining was of red silk, and that it was surmounted
by a superb bunch of feathers. Before the period
of which we speak, it is probable that the French
covered their heads in the same way as the English,
that is to say, with woven caps or rather with
cloth and silk hoods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stockings of the ancients were made of little
pieces of cloth sewed together. We cannot say
with certainty in what country the stocking-frame
was invented. France, England and Spain respectively
claim this useful discovery. A short time
before the unfortunate tournament, in which Henry
II. lost his life, he put on the first pair of silk
stockings ever worn. Five years afterward, we see
in England, William Ryder presenting a pair, as a
very precious article, to William, Earl of Pembroke.
Ryder had learnt the method of making
them from an Italian merchant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many persons probably know not that <span class='it'>wooden
shoes</span> date from a very remote period; for the
Jews wore them long before the age of Augustus.
Perhaps they were not made exactly like the
wooden shoes so common among the poorer
classes in France; but it is not less true that
this kind of covering for the feet was generally
adopted among nearly all the people of Judæa:
sometimes, however, we observe leather shoes
among them; and the Jewish soldiers covered
their feet with copper, or with iron. The shoes
of the Egyptians were of <span class='it'>papyrus</span>; the Chinese
and the Indians manufactured theirs of silk, of
rushes, of the bark of trees, of iron, of brass, of
gold or of silver, according as their fortune permitted,
or their fancy dictated. At Rome, as in
Greece, leather was the material which covered
the feet of every one. The Roman women wore
<span class='it'>white</span> shoes: the common people wore <span class='it'>black</span>: and
the magistrates set off their feet with <span class='it'>red</span> shoes on
solemn occasions. A thousand years ago the most
powerful sovereigns of Europe had wooden soles
to their shoes. Under William Rufus, son of the
great Duke of Normandy, who conquered at Hastings,
in 1066, a fashion was introduced into England
of giving to the shoes an excessive length;
the point which terminated them was stuffed with
tow, and curved up on high like a ram’s horn. In
the fourteenth century they thought of connecting
these points with the knee, by means of a gold
chain. Great must have been the surprise of the
worthy Anglo-Saxons, on beholding this strange
species of vegetation sprouting up suddenly amongst
them! Some called to remembrance the history of
the serpent’s teeth, which Cadmus sowed, whence
a swarm of soldiers issued; others conceived that
it was the costume of magicians; and little children
sometimes, when going to bed, asked their mothers
if there was no danger that their heads might be
metamorphosed in the night into those of a horrible
deer? Before leaving this paragraph upon shoes,
we would call to recollection the antiquity of the
art of the leather-dresser: open for that purpose the
Iliad, and you will find in the Seventeenth Book,
tanners preparing skins to make leather of them.
This class of manufacturers composed, three hundred
years ago, a very important body, since we
possess the account of a furious quarrel which
broke out, under Queen Elizabeth, between them
and the shoe-makers. We are pleased to record
here the perfection with which they manufacture
leather at this date in the New World. In South
Carolina, as well as in the state of Virginia, the
Indian women are so skilful in this branch of
industry that a single person can dress as many
as ten deer-skins a day.<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> Of all the transformations
which are wrought in the arts, that of the
animal substance into leather is, without doubt,
one of the most curious. The process, by means
of which they set about accomplishing it in old
times, was the result of a calculation still more
ingenious than that of changing two opaque bodies
into a transparent body to make glass, for instance;
or else two transparent bodies into an opaque body
for making soap. Besides, you know that chemistry
actually teaches us that leather is a real salt, a
<span class='it'>tannate of gelatine</span>. This assertion was not uttered
with confidence until M. Pelouze had extracted from
tan in late years the tannic acid in a state of remarkable
purity. Besides this, you may now explain
a phenomena which is repeated at a great
distance upon the ocean, at the time of some
lamentable shipwreck. The journal which records
for you the history of one of these sad events often
tells you that in the last moment of famine, the
unhappy survivors took to eating their shoes, and
that life is sometimes prolonged by these means!
Certainly, for the gelatine possesses nutritious properties,
even when its peculiarities are stained with
a thousand impurities, as is leather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subject upon which we have endeavored to
present some observations, is so capable of being
extended that a large volume in octavo would
scarcely suffice to contain all the historical knowledge
relating to it. But such a dissertation, carried
out to the extent or with the exactness which it
admits of, would only constitute at last a kind of
catalogue or bare enumeration of the thousand
modifications which human vestures have undergone
down to our times. The memory of the reader
would be unable to retain so prodigious a number
of minute particulars, and the curiosity of his mind,
fatigued by so many useless details, would be extinguished
before finishing the third part. These
changes have often, it is true, nothing for their
object but the accessory and secondary parts of
dress, as the following passage, which we meet
with in the <span class='it'>voyages</span> of M. de Chateaubriand, seems
to point out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One thing has at the same time struck me and
charmed me; I have met in the dress of the Auvergne
peasant the attire of the Breton peasant.
Whence comes this? It is because there was formerly
for this kingdom, and for all Europe, a
<span class='it'>groundwork</span> of a common attire.” (Vol. 2., p. 296.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another particular also, men have always been
constant, that they have never ceased to seek for
the material to compose their clothing from the
animals which the Creator has placed in their respective
climates. It will probably be the same till
the end of the world. It is thus that the nations
under the temperate zone have recourse for covering
to wool, because, being a bad conductor of caloric, it
prevents the escape of it from their bodies. In the
frozen zone the Russians, the Esquimaux, and the
Greenlanders, clothe themselves in furs, a material
which is a still worse conductor of caloric; while
the natives of countries under the influence of the
torrid zone, make their dresses of hair or horse-hair,
whose conducting properties are in an inverse ratio
to those of furs. It is worth remarking that the
animals which in temperate regions are covered
with wool or ordinary hair, are provided, when
they inhabit countries really cold, with an under-fleece
of very fine wool: it is the case with goats,
sheep, dogs, horses, and Thibet cows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If by a game of metempsychosis, you were enabled
to return to existence two hundred years hence,
what unheard of changes would you not see in
the dress of individuals. Transport in anticipation
your shade to a point commanding one of the public
promenades of the capital; suppose yourself, for instance,
on the top of the Vendôme Column, on a
fine summer’s evening; you would, perhaps, perceive
the <span class='it'>dandies</span> of the time strutting in frocks, whose
leg of mutton sleeves are as voluminous as those of
our sylphides at this day. Their hats, instead of
being of beaver or of fur, have a similar shape to
that which our ladies adopted in 1839. For the
young folks a notched veil would be the prescribed
mode; the men, of a certain age, would embellish
their hats with a superb scarlet plume. As to the
women, who will now dare to affirm that they will
not then cover their heads with perukes <span class='it'>à la</span> Louis
XIV. topped off with three-cocked hats, and that
from their chin there will not descend a band <span class='it'>à la
procureur du roi</span>? Extend your Pythagorean glance
farther into the ages, and you will, perhaps, discover
another part of mankind adding to their dress an
enormous pair of wings! We may doubt that the
gnomes, the sciences, will never render the attempt
to make use of them more effectual than that of
the son of Dædalus in old times; but in return,
posterity may fly by another process, in case
the æronauts can discover the secret of steering
themselves in mid-air. Should this expectation be
realised, we may then hear one of your future
grand-nieces (who will be the belles of the noble
Faubourg) say to her domestic on rising from
her breakfast, “Ganymede! my balloon, with its
boat; I wish to go dine to-day with my cousin,
at Florence.”</p>

<p class='line0'>Our crime is to be man and wish to know:</p>

<p class='line0'>With God, thy title is to be his work;</p>

<p class='line0'>He strives to sound the world; his eye is weak;—</p>
<p class='line0'>He yearns to love; whate’er he loves is frail.</p>
<p class='line0'>All mortals unto Eden’s exile bear</p>
<p class='line0'>A sad resemblance—when his outraged God</p>
<p class='line0'>Had banished him from that celestial realm,</p>
<p class='line0'>Scanning the fatal limits with a look,</p>
<p class='line0'>He sat him, weeping, near the barred gates,</p>
<p class='line0'>He heard within the blest abode afar,</p>
<p class='line0'>The sigh harmonious of eternal love,</p>
<p class='line0'>Sweet strains of happiness, the choral song</p>
<p class='line0'>Of angels sounding God’s triumphant praise;</p>
<p class='line0'>And tearing then his soul from heav’n, his eye</p>
<p class='line0'>Fell back affrighted on his dismal lot.</p>
<p class='line0'>Woe, woe to him who from his exile here</p>
<p class='line0'>Hath heard the concerts of an envied world!</p>
<p class='line0'>When Nature once ideal nectar tastes,</p>
<p class='line0'>She loathes the cup Reality presents.</p>
<p class='line0'>Into the possible, in dreams she leaps;</p>

<p class='line0'>Such was thy fate, and such my destiny!</p>
<p class='line0'>I too the poisoned cup did drain; like thine</p>
<p class='line0'>My eyes were opened, seeing not; in vain</p>
<p class='line0'>I sought the enigma of the universe;</p>
<p class='line0'>I questioned nature for its cause; I asked</p>
<p class='line0'>Each creature why created; down the abyss,</p>
<p class='line0'>The bottomless abyss, I plunged my look;</p>
<p class='line0'>From the atom to the sun, I all explored;</p>
<p class='line0'>Anticipated time, its stream did mount;</p>
<p class='line0'>Now passing over seas to hear the words</p>

<p class='line0'>Now, to divine the world inanimate.</p>

<p class='line0'>Like to the sybil in her rage divine,</p>
<p class='line0'>I fancied nature in those fearful scenes</p>
<p class='line0'>Some portion of her secrets might reveal:</p>

<p class='line0'>But vainly in her calm and in her rage</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> Life Guard of Washington! Who can
think upon this band of gallant spirits without
feeling a glow of patriotism warming his heart,
and stirring up the sluggish feelings of his soul?
Fancy paints again the figures which history has
suffered to fade away, as the shadows departed
from the magic mirror of Cornelius Agrippa; and
the heroes of the past start up before us like the
clan of Roderick Dhu at the sound of their chieftain’s
whistle. They come from Cambridge, and
from the Hudson, from Trenton and from Princeton,
from Yorktown and from the Brandywine, from
mountain pass and woody vale, gathering in battle
array around the lowly bed of their sleeping leader,
amid the solitary shades of Vernon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The life guardsmen are fast fading away. One
by one the aged members have departed, and now
Lee’s corporal slumbers beside his commander.
Their march of life is over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A more efficient corps never existed on this side
of the Atlantic than the Life Guard. Animated by
one motive, guided by one object, they surrounded
their beloved commander-in-chief, and gloried in
being known as his body guard. Was there any
difficult duty to perform? it fell to this body, and
gallantly did they perform the service entrusted
to them. The eye of the general glistened with
delight as they filed before him in the shade of
evening, or returned into camp from some successful
incursion beyond the enemy’s lines, ere</p>

<p class='noindent'>or the <span class='it'>reveillé</span> aroused the army from their slumbers.</p>

<hr class='tbk116'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was the anniversary of the battle of Princeton,
when an aged man, with a stout staff in his hand,
was seen trudging manfully down Broadway. As
he passed along from square to square, he cast his
eyes upon the signs and door-plates, and muttering,
continued on his course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” said he, “was Clinton’s Quarters”—“Edward
Mallory silks and laces”—“and here was
the house that Washington stopped at”—“John
Knipherhausen, tobacconist,” “and here was where
the pretty Quakeress lived, who used to furnish the
commander-in-chief with information as to the
enemies movements”—“Câfé de mille colonnes”—“all,
all are changed; time has been busy with every
thing but the seasons—they are the same—the sun
and the rain—the evening and the morning—the
icicle and the dew-drop—the frost and the snow-drift
change not: but man and his habitations—aye,
the very names of places and people have been
altered, and the New York of the Revolution is
not the New York of ’37.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the old man said this he seated himself upon
a marble door-step, and wiped the perspiration from
his brow; for he had walked a long way that morning,
and the thousand associations that pressed upon
his memory wearied him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A company of volunteers, in all the pomp and
circumstance of city war, now approached by a
cross street. The bugle’s shrill note, mingled in
with the clarionet and cymbals; and the glance of
the sun upon their bayonets and polished helmets,
lit up the martial fire that slumbered in the old
man’s soul. He rose upon his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is pleasant enough now to look upon such
gatherings,” said he, “but those who have heard
the drums beat to drown the cries of the wounded
and the dying, cannot forget their meaning, though
youth and joy accompany them, and though the
smiles of beauty urge them on.” And the old man
wept, for the men of other days stood about him;
and the battle-fields, then silent and deserted, teemed
with the dead and the dying; and the blood formed
in pools amid the trampled grass, or trickled in little
rills down the smoky hill-side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A servant now came out of a neighboring house
and invited the old man in. He thankfully accepted
the hospitality of the polite citizen, and soon stood
in a comfortable breakfast room. A young man of
twenty-one received him with kindness; and a tall,
prim woman of eighty-six cordially insisted upon his
joining her family at the breakfast-table. A beautiful
girl of eighteen took the old man’s hat and
cane, and wheeled up an old arm-chair that had
done the family some service in ancient days. The
old man as she seated herself beside him, patted
her upon the head, and a firm—“God bless you”—escaped
from his wrinkled and pallid lips. The
old lady suddenly paused in her tea-table duty, and
looked earnestly at her guest. The old man’s eyes
met hers—they had seen each other before—but
the mists of time shrouded their memories, and
blended names and places and periods strangely
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will thee have another cup of tea?” said the
matron to the old man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have heard that voice,” thought the stranger,
as he took the proffered cup with gratitude, and
finished his breakfast in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! grandmother,” said the maiden, springing
to the window, “here come the Iron Greys; how
splendidly they look.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot look at them,” said the matron, in a
trembling voice—“thy grandfather was killed by
the Brunswick Greys at Princeton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was his name?” said the old man, fixing
his dim eye steadily upon the speaker’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charles Greely,” said the matron, shedding an
unexpected tear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charles Greely,” said the old man springing
up—“why he was a Life Guardsman, and died by
my side—I buried him at the hour of twilight by
the milestone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And thou art?” said the matron, earnestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old Hugh Maxwell, a corporal of Washington’s
Life Guard at your service,” said the stranger
guest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! well do I know thee,” said the matron,
weeping—“it was thee who gave me directions
where to find him, and delivered to me his dying
sigh. This is an unhappy day to me, Hugh Maxwell,
but thy presence lends an interest to it that I
had no idea of enjoying. William and Anne, thy
grandfather died upon Hugh Maxwell’s breast in
battle—let us bless God that we are permitted to
entertain the gallant soldier upon the anniversary
of that day of glory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the son brought forth the old family bible,
and the widow Greely prayed after the manner of
the Quakers, amid her little congregation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the service was over, and the breakfast
equipage had been removed, the son and the daughter
each drew a seat beside the old veteran, while
their grandmother carefully wiped her spectacles
and took a moderate pinch of Maccouba. Then
seating herself as straight as a drill sergeant in her
cushioned seat in the corner, she turned her <span class='it'>well
ear</span> toward the old corporal and looked out of the
window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us about the battle of Trenton and of
Princeton, Mr. Maxwell,” said the grand-children,
in one voice. The old man looked inquiringly at
the widow Greely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thee may tell it, though it may be a sad tale
to me,” said the matron, and Hugh Maxwell, after
resting his head upon his hand for a moment, began
his account of</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE BATTLES OF TRENTON AND PRINCETON.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The twenty-fifth of December, 1776, was a
gloomy day in the American camp. An army of
thirty thousand British soldiers lay scattered along
the opposite side of the freezing Delaware, from
Brunswick to the environs of Philadelphia. Gen.
Howe commanded the British cantonment, and
Lord Cornwallis was on the march from New
York to reinforce him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The British soldiers were flushed with success.
They had driven us through the Jerseys. New
York Island and the North River were in their
power. They had tracked us by our bloody foot-prints
along the gloomy, though snow-clad hills:
and they looked eagerly forward to the day when
the head of our illustrious Washington should be
placed upon Temple Bar, and the mob of London
should cry out while they pointed at it, “there rests
the head of a Traitor.” The banner of England
floated heavily in the wintry air, and the fur-clad
Hessian paced his rounds on the gloomy hills, with
his bayonet gleaming in the stormy light; videttes
were seen galloping along the hill sides, and the
valleys echoed with the martial airs of England.
But in our camp all was sadness. Five thousand
men, ill-armed, and worse clad, without tents or
even camp utensils, sat crouching over their lonely
watch-fires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this was not all. The crafty British general
had offered a pardon to all who would desert the
American cause, and many men of property, aye!
even members of Congress, recreant to honor and
principle, pocketed their patriotism with the proclamation,
and basely betrayed their country in the
hour of her peril. Members of Congress did I say?
Yes, those that had been members: and let me
repeat their names, lest perchance they may have
been forgotten in the age of sham power and
speculation. Galloway and Allen deserted, and
joined the enemies of freedom in the fall of 1776.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the state of things at this period. All
was silence in the American camp. The spangled
banner hung drooping over our head quarters, and
the sentinel by the low door-way stood leaning in
melancholy mood upon his rusty and flintless gun.
The commander-in-chief held a council of war. At
the close of it he gave his opinion—he had heard
of the scattered cantonment of the British army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said he striking his hand upon an order
of battle, and pointing from the window of the little
farm house toward the wild river, “now is the time
to clip their wings.” It was a master-thought; the
council of war concurred with their leader, and
each member retired silently to prepare for immediate
action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The regiments were mustered—the sentinels were
called in—a hasty meal was devoured—the evening
shut in with darkness and storm—the word was
given—and we began our march. One party moved
down, one remained stationary, and one passed up
to a point above Trenton. I was with Washington.
No one in the ranks knew where he was to go—all
was mystery; until we wheeled down the steep
bank of the Delaware.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Onward,” was the word. “Cross the river,”
thundered along the line, and our freezing legions
moved on. Who shall describe the pains and the
perils of that terrible march? Who shall reward
the noble spirits, who, trusting in their illustrious
leader, moved onward, amid famine, nakedness, and
the winter’s storm? Surely at this day a generous
nation will not let the poor, old veteran die who
has his scars—but no certificate—to testify to the
glory of that night—better feed an imposter than
starve a hero.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to my tale.—Upon a high bank Washington,
and Knox, and a few staff officers, wrapped in scanty
military cloaks, sat upon their shivering chargers,
and awaited the progress of the broken line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We moved on—some on cakes of ice—some on
rafts with the artillery—and some in little boats.
Dark reigned the night around—the wild blast from
the hills swept down the roaring stream—the water
froze to our tattered clothes, and our feet were
blistered and peeled by treading upon the icy way.
The snow, like feathers borne upon a gale, whirled
around us—the dark waters yawned fearfully before
us—at every step we were in danger. Now precipitated
into the stream, and now forced to climb
the rugged sides of the drift-ice, still we advanced.
At length the cannon and tumbrils were landed, and
the last soldier stood upon the opposite shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shivering with cold, and pale with hunger and
fatigue, our column formed and waited for the word.
Washington and his staff were at hand. “Briskly,
men, briskly,” said he, as he rode to the head of
the line; and then the captains gave the word from
company to company, and the army marched on in
silence. A secret movement of an army at night
keeps the drowsy awake, and the hungry from
complaining. Man is an inquisitive animal, and
the only way to make him perform apparent impossibilities,
is to lead him after he knows not
what. Columbus discovered America in a cruize
after Solomon’s gold mine, and the vast field of
chemistry was laid open to human ken, in a search
for the elixir of life, and the philosopher’s stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All night our troops moved down the west bank
of the river, and as the morning spread her grey
mantle over the eastern hills, we reached Trenton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hessians, under Rawle, slept. No one feared
Washington,—and the moustached soldier dreamed
of the Rhine and the Elbe, and the captain slept
careless at his inn. But suddenly the cry was
raised,—“He comes! he comes!” Our frosty
drums beat the charge; the shrill fifes mingled in
with a merry strain; and our hungry army, with
bare feet entered the city. Like the Scandinavian
horde—in impetuosity and necessity—before the
eternal city, we rushed up the streets, and attacked
the surprised enemy at every turn. The startled
foe endeavored to defend themselves; but, before
any body of them could collect, a charge of our
infantry cut them to pieces. Their colors were
absolutely hacked off of their standard-staff, while
they advanced in line, by a sergeant’s sword, and
their officers were cut down or taken prisoners.
Our victory was complete. One thousand men were
killed and made prisoners, and the artillery, consisting
of nine pieces, was captured. Such was the
effect of the Battle of Trenton upon the enemy;
but to us the consequences were the reverse. Our
hungry men were fed, our naked were clothed, the
rank and file were armed, and the officers promoted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same evening we re-crossed the river, but it
was not the terrible stream of the previous night.
The foot-prints of boots and shoes were left on our
trail, and the drums beat a merry call, while the
bugles answered sweet and clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few hours the Hessian tents shrouded the
captors on the site of our old encampment; and
Rawle’s officers had the pleasure of drinking <span class='it'>their
own wine in their own tents</span>, with General Washington,
and his subalterns, as prisoners of war. So
well planned was this attack that we lost but nine
men, and two of them were frozen to death after
being wounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 29th of December, 1776, we again crossed
the Delaware, and at 1 P. M., our eagles floated
over Trenton.</p>

<hr class='tbk117'/>

<p class='pindent'>The “merry Christmas” of our evening party
astonished and aroused the king’s generals. Lord
Cornwallis hastened to form a junction with General
Grant at Princeton; and on the 2d of January,
1777, the British army marched against Trenton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was late in the afternoon when the advance
guard of the enemy appeared in sight, their red
coats forming a striking contrast with the winter’s
snow. Our drums now beat to arms, and General
Washington, with 5,000 of us, crossed the rivulet
Assumpinck, and took post upon the high ground
facing the rivulet. A heavy cannonade speedily
commenced, and when night came on, both armies
had a breathing spell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fresh fuel was now piled upon the camp-fires—the
sentinels were posted in advance—small parties
were stationed to guard each ford—the cry, “all’s
well,” the quick challenge, and the prompt answer;
the tramping of a returning vidette—and the occasional
tapping of a drum in the guard-room, were
heard in our camp. The British general rejoiced
in the belief that the morning sun would behold
him a conqueror of our leader and ourselves. Secure
of his prey, the enemy made preparations to
attack our camp on the first blush of morning. The
noise of hammers—the heavy rumbling of cannon
wheels—the clashing of the armorer’s hammer, and
the laugh of the artizan and pioneer, came over
upon the night-wind, and grated harshly upon our
sensitive ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An officer, mounted, and wrapped in a military
cloak, was now seen silently approaching the commanders
of regiments in quick succession. He
whispered his orders in a low tone—the colonels
started with astonishment,—they looked—it was
their general, and they immediately sent for their
captains. Each officer heard the new order with
astonishment, but to hear was to obey. The captains
whispered it to their orderlies, and in twenty
minutes after it was communicated to commanders
of regiments the whole army stood upon their feet
in battle array. Our tents were struck, and our
baggage wagons were ready for a march.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sentinels paced their rounds as though
nothing was about to happen. The laugh of the
relieved guard was heard above the din of both
armies, and “all’s well” rang above the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now stood ready in open column to march.
General Hugh Mercer had command of the van-guard,
and in a few moments our captains whispered,
“forward, and be silent”—our living mass
immediately moved onward, and filed off toward
Allentown. Presently we heard the rear guard,
with the artillery, rumbling in our rear, and then
our camp, so quietly deserted, was lost sight of in
the shadow of the hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For upward of two hours we moved on in comparative
silence. Nothing but the whispers of the
officers, and the heavy tread of men was heard. It
was quite dark, and every breast seemed to be under
the spell of mystery. At length a noise was heard
ahead, and a staff officer galloped to the rear. As
he passed along he said, in a clear voice, “the enemy
are in sight.” In a few minutes the voice of the
gallant Mercer was heard loud and distinct, giving
his orders—“attention, van-guard, close order,
quick time, march.” We sprang at the word—each
soldier grasped his musket with a firmer gripe—and
away we went upon the run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three regiments of light-infantry opposed us
upon the plain at Maidenhead, and their drums
were beating merrily as we drew near them—our
front now came upon an open common. We broke
into three columns, and headed by the gallant Mercer,
dashed on. In a moment a stream of fire
passed along the British line, the dead and wounded
fell around me, and our columns wavered. At this
instant while General Mercer, with his sword
raised, was encouraging the van-guard to rush on
and secure the victory, a bullet struck him, and he
fell from his horse mortally wounded. For a moment
only the battle was against us, but soon the
firm voice of Washington was heard, as he pressed
on to the front. Our musketry now echoed terribly;
the enemy began to give way; a well-directed
fire from the artillery told fearfully upon the small
armed foe, and they were routed. At this moment
a British soldier clapped his bayonet to my breast—Charles
Greely thrust it away with his right hand—the
soldier fired—his musket and the noble-hearted
Greely fell upon my breast. I grasped his hand—it
faintly returned my pressure—and then he straitened
himself upon the ground, his eyes became fixed, his
jaw fell, and he was dead. I bore him quickly to
a wounded cart, and hastened to my platoon. The
enemy were flying toward Brunswick, and we were
masters of the field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On to Princeton,” shouted our noble leader, as
he sent his wounded aid to the rear on a litter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The line moved on in quick time, and soon we
entered the town. Our visit was as unexpected
here as at Trenton. A portion of the enemy had
taken shelter in the college. Our general, as at
Trenton, headed the charge in gallant style, while
the troops, animated by his fearlessness, nobly seconded
him. The artillery thundered against the
garrisoned college, and the musketry rung wildly
from every corner. Surrounded by a superior force,
and not knowing but what Cornwallis had been
routed, for they had heard the midnight cannon at
Maidenhead, most of the enemy surrendered. A
few, however, escaped by a precipitate flight along
an unguarded street at the commencement of the
attack. In this affair one hundred of the enemy
were killed, and three hundred taken prisoners.
Lord Cornwallis, as he lay on his camp bed, was
roused by the roar of cannon. He started—the
sound came from Princeton—he immediately ordered
his troops under arms, and hastened to the
scene of action. When he arrived the battle was
won, and we were on our return march in triumph.
As we crossed the Milestone river, we were halted
to destroy the bridge at Kingston. I ordered a
file of men to assist me, and hastily buried my
companion in arms by the water-side, while the
enemy’s cannon answered for minute-guns for the
brave. Having shed a tear of sympathy over his
lonely grave, we joined the main-body. At sun-set
we trod upon the bleak hills of Morristown, and
when the camp-fires were lighted the campaign of
’76 was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the old man finished his tale, the widow
turned away her head, and the grand-children hid
their faces and wept. At length when they raised
their eyes to their guest, his face was pallid—a
wildness was manifest in his eyes; and his frame
appeared to be stiffening in death. They sprang to
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forward—on—to—Princeton!” said he, in a
cold whisper; and then the last Life Guardsman
joined his companions in Heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day a numerous body of strangers followed
the old veteran to the tomb; and the widow
Greely placed a plain marble slab at the head of it,
and inscribed upon it—</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Dark</span> as the mouth of Acheron, and the rain
seems inclined to warrant a second deluge,” grumbled
a rough voice, proceeding from one of the dark
alleys which branched out from the Porta san
Piero.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence, rascal!” sharply rejoined another voice.
“Wouldst betray us with thy noise? Thou wouldst
have the <span class='it'>bargello</span> upon us, with a murrain! Dost
thou think that thou art brawling over thy liquor,
that thou wouldst bring the notice of the police
upon us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, I but spoke,” growled the other, and
muffling himself up in his heavy cloak, leaned
against the wall and held his peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night was truly, as the first speaker observed,
as black as Tartarus. The rain plashed down in
torrents; and the squalls of wind which occasionally
drove the showers with accelerated rapidity
across the street, whistled dismally among the tall
turrets and battlemented roofs of the Porta san
Piero. The street was obscured by a thick mist,
through which the feeble light of the flickering
lamps, hung in the centre of the thoroughfare, at
long distances from each other, shone like lurid
meteors. Few wayfarers lingered in the passage,
and such as were to be seen, with rapid strides, and
close-wrapped cloaks, hurried over the wet and
slippery stones, which formed a kind of rude <span class='it'>pavé</span>.
Two figures, enveloped in large mantles, the actors
in the dialogue, were carefully ensconced in the thick
darkness of the blind alley, apparently upon the
watch for some expected comer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The turret clock of San Marco pealed the hour
of ten, and as if waiting for the signal, the wind
rose with increased fury, and spouts of water deluged
the persons of the concealed parties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Corpo di Baccho!” swore the first speaker,
“by the clock it is ten already, and yet no signs of
Ugolino. My mantle cleaves to the skin with the
wet, and altogether I feel more like a half-drowned
rat, than a good Catholic. By my rosary, a bright
fire, and a comfortable cup of father Borachio’s Lachryma,
would be an excellent exchange for a dark
alley and a waterspout like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something has detained his honor beyond this
time,” replied the other. “Count Ugolino was not
wont to be so slow in keeping his engagements.
Hark! I hear footsteps. It must be he. Stand
close.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A merry laugh pealed through the deserted street.
A troop of gallants, masked, and attended by serving-men,
and pages bearing torches, came onward.
They passed by, and the clank of their spurs, and
the rattle of their rapiers, died away in the distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The cursed Frenchmen!” muttered the shortest
of the concealed personages, while his hand clutched
convulsively the hilt of his dagger. “Ill fare the
day that Florence ever saw Walter of Brienne!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But as morn approaches the night is ever most
dark,” rejoined his comrade. “Would the count
were here. By the scales of justice I am even
a’weary of waiting for him. Comes he not yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tall figure was seen stealthily approaching
through the gloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! Ugolino! Count, is it thou?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The same. Well found, Pino D’Rossi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have watched long for thee, and almost
feared that our watch was in vain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could not escape unnoticed. It is a wild
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fitter for our purpose. The worthy Adimari
greets thee well, and joyfully receives thee as
a brother. We are ready to conduct thee to the
assembly of the chiefs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In good time. Is Pompeo Medici there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is there; to hear and to act.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is well. But time flies, and our conversation
is too public if these slaves of the <span class='it'>bargello</span> be about.
Let us away to the noble Adimari.” So saying,
the three plunged into the surrounding darkness,
and were quickly lost to the sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an ancient vault of the palace of the Adimari,
the leaders of a conspiracy were assembled. Noble
forms and manly visages thronged the damp and
obscure apartment, and among the noblest in presence
stood Leonardo, the chief of the Adimari.
But the countenances of the nobles who composed
the meeting, were dark and troubled. The flashing
eye and the quivering lip betrayed the deep passions
which agitated the breasts of the chiefs, as, in the
course of their dialogue, some new cruelty, some
fresh instance of tyranny and rapacity upon the part
of the Duke d’Atene, was recited. A tap was heard
at the grated door, and Leonardo Adimari having
personally opened it, Ugolino and his two companions
entered the apartment. The count had thrown
off his reeking mantle, and stood attired in a rich
scarlet doublet, fancifully guarded with gold embroidery,
white long hose, and ruffled boots, which
exposed his manly person to the best advantage.
His locks, of a dark chestnut hue, flowed in long
ringlets from beneath a scarlet barret cap, adorned
with a jewelled clasp and plume of white heron feathers.
His countenance, chiselled in the finest and
most classical shape, was rendered highly expressive
by his dark eyes, which rolled and sparkled with
Italian vivacity of character. His form, sufficiently
fleshy for a perfect contour, displayed great muscular
strength, united with the most finished symmetry.
Depending from a richly ornamented scarf, hung his
rapier in its ornamented sheath, and his dagger, of
elegant workmanship, was suspended from the embroidered
hangers of his girdle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Welcome, noble Ugolino,” said Adimari, as he
led the count forward, “and thou too, worthy Pino
D’Rossi, we lack patriots such as thou.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, noble Adimari,” replied D’Rossi, who
was a short, sturdy man, attired in a plain, black
suit. His age might have been some forty-five
years, for his hair was already tinged with gray. A
golden chain, depending from his neck, denoted him
to be of some mark among the citizens, and his
countenance and deportment were those of a stalwart
burgher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, worthy Adimari. Patriots are never
wanting to defend true liberty, when she is attacked,
and was it ever heard that Frenchmen were the
guardians of the goddess?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brave Leonardo,” said an old nobleman, rising
slowly from his seat, “these times call for a speedy
action. The blood of a noble family—the blood of
my son, Giovanni de Medici—long-spilt, and even
now staining the ermine of Walter of Brienne, calls
from the earth for vengeance. This moment is
propitious. The Florentine people, grieved and
oppressed by the hard measures of the Duke, and of
Giulio D’Assisi—the Florentine nobles, down-trodden
and despised by the arrogant followers of this
count of Brienne—all are ready—all are willing at
once to throw off the yoke of thraldom, and to reassert
the ancient liberties and privileges of the city
of Florence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well hast thou spoken, noble Pompeo,” replied
Adimari, “and it was my intention to apportion
this night to each, such charge as the exigencies of
the present time demand. My worthy friend, Pino
D’Rossi assures me that the people are ripe for the
attempt, and my heart decides me that the nobles
will not fail to aid them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The arrogance of these minions of the duke
have reached so outrageous a height,” said D’Rossi,
“that I will pledge mine honor that the populace
will prefer a thousand deaths to a longer submission.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I,” said Bindo Altoviti, “will speak for the artizans,
and will engage to make as many mouthsful
of those rascals, the <span class='it'>bargello</span> and his son, as they
have murdered innocent men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For Gualtieri,” said the old Medici, “may the
hand of the Everlasting lie heavy on me and mine,
if he, or aught of his race, shall escape the general
doom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ugolino started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For mine own part,” said he, “I trust that the
effusion of blood may not be farther pursued in
these unhappy times than the exigency of the case
requires. Far be it from me to justify the conduct
of the Count of Brienne, or the arrogance of his
proud followers. Yet the count may have been
badly advised, and I think these cruelties may not
be entirely ascribed to the wickedness of his nature.
Let not the noble Medici so far mistake, as to suffer
a private desire of revenge, however just such a
desire may appear, to overrule the cause of liberty.
This, I trust, may be attained without a sanguinary
massacre. Let the sword of mercy interpose, nor
by a blind and indiscriminate fury, sacrifice the innocent
upon the same altar with the guilty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, Count Ugolino,” said Medici, and a bitter
sneer passed over his thin features, “we well know
the cause of your solicitations. Have we forgotten
the tale of Julian D’Este, and of the princess Rosabelle?
The fair sister of Walter of Brienne may,
to a moonsick lover, be an object of deeper interest
than the prosecution of the holiest revenge, or the
re-assertion of our Florentine liberty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, by heaven, Pompeo Medici,” exclaimed
Ugolino, “you do me infinite wrong! What? dare
you hint that Julian D’Este died by my hand? or
that Rosabelle de Brienne sways me with a stronger
attachment than the interests of Florence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I speak well-known facts,” replied the Medici.
“Neither is the history of Count Ugolino unknown
to the world, nor are his <span class='it'>actions</span> left unscrutinized.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou irreverend noble!” said Ugolino, while a
deep flush overspread his cheek. “Hadst thou not
the sanction of thine age to protect thee, I would
force thee to eat thine own words, with no better
sauce to them than my stiletto.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay,” interposed Adimari, while Pino D’Rossi
intercepted Ugolino, “these matters will break out
again into our ancient broils. Worthy Medici—valiant
Ugolino—listen to reason—nay, Pompeo,
sheathe thy sword—this is utter ruin to our general
cause!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ugolino returned his dagger to its sheath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Count Adimari,” said he, “I regret that the
words of yon ancient libeller should have moved
me so far from my patience in this presence. But
enough of this—proceed we to matters of more
general import.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mark me, Leonardo,” said old Medici, as he
slowly resumed his seat. “Ages have left us many
a sad example. In an ill hour was Ugolino admitted
into this league. Strong is the dominion of a
beautiful woman over the most masculine mind.
Beware of yon count, for Rosabelle de Brienne will
be the destruction of either himself, or of the cause
of Florentine liberty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A smile of scorn curled the lip of Ugolino.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I receive not the prophecy,” said he. “The
hour waxes late, and the noble Adimari hath intimated
his desire to apportion the charge of this
insurrection among the nobles. It is now the
time for action, but thou and I, Pompeo Medici,
must confer still farther.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On the same night upon which the above related
events took place, the ducal palace was brilliantly
illuminated, and sounds of festivity proceeded from
the lofty portals. Duke Gualtieri held his high
revel. Troops of noble cavaliers and throngs of
high-born dames filled the grand hall of audience,
at the top of which was the duke, seated upon an
elevated dais, covered with superb hangings, and
surrounded by the military chiefs of his faction.
Gualtieri was a tall, muscular man of fifty, in the
expression of whose countenance a sort of soldierly
frankness struggled with a fierce and scornful air.
He was splendidly attired in a tunic of purple velvet,
with hose of rich sendal, and over his shoulder
was thrown his ermined cloak. His head was
covered with the ducal coronet, and his neck encircled
by a gorgeous chain of twisted gold and jewellery.
Near him stood Giulio D’Assisi, the dreaded
<span class='it'>bargello</span>, or head of police. This last was a man
of middle age, attired in scarlet robes, with a face
strongly marked by the traces of brutal passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A higher measure!” shouted the duke. “By
the honor of the virgin, I think our cavaliers be
ungracious to-night, or else these fair dames are
more intent upon their beads than their lavoltas.
Ha! gallants? hath our air of Florence so dull
and muddy a taste to the cavaliers of Provence,
that it seemeth to quench the fire of their courtesy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By my halidome!” said the <span class='it'>bargello</span>, “your
highness speaks well and merrily. The air of Florence,
methinks, hath an exceeding thick complexion,
in comparison with the more delicate breezes which
fan the soil of France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou hast aided to thicken it with a vengeance,”
said the duke with a grim smile. “Ha,
Giulio, the blood of these swine of Florence, whom
thou draggest to thy shambles, might well make the
air murky?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the patrimony of St. Peter,” replied D’Assisi,
“it is but a needful phlebotomy. Marry, if the
leech were more often employed in cleansing the
veins of your Florentine state, it were good for the
health and purification of the remaining body politic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou art the prince of provosts, my friend,”
said the duke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, Rinaldo, is it thou? and away from the
fair Matilde? When did this happen before in
Florence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The person addressed was a tall, elegant cavalier,
whose manly countenance was rendered yet
more interesting by the melancholy expression of
his eyes. He was plainly, but handsomely attired
in a costly suit of dark brown velvet, embroidered
with seed pearls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May it please your highness,” said Rinaldo,
Comte D’Hunteville, (for he was no less a personage,)
“I have news of some import to communicate.
An esquire of mine, passing this night through the
Porta san Piero, discovered a person, whom he recognized
as Pino D’Rossi, the chief of the <span class='it'>balia</span>,
accompanied by the Count Ugolino, and one whom
he knew not, proceeding in the direction of the palace
of the Adimari. There are also rumors of
seditious meetings which have been held there, and
I fear—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tush, man,” interrupted De Brienne. “Canst
speak of business when so fair a throng of ladies
decks our court? or couple the word fear with these
dogs of Florence? They shall be cared for; but
they have lost the power to harm. Marry, as for
the will, we doubt not of that. As for that notorious
villain, Ugolino, who has dared to aspire to
the hand of our sister,” continued he, while the fire
of rage sparkled in his eyes, “and through whom
such infamous aspersions have been cast upon the
honor of the house of Brienne, I have my spies
upon him. The least imprudent action he dares
commit, our trusty Giulio will take order it be not
repeated. Forward, Comte D’Hunteville, to the
dance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardly had the duke spoken these words, ere a
man of singularly unprepossessing countenance, entered
the apartment. He was of small stature, with
a dark, thin visage; restless, inquisitive eyes, and a
hooked nose. He wore a plain, civil suit, and a
walking rapier, more for ornament than use, decorated
his side. Quickly approaching the duke,
he whispered a few words in his ear. The duke
started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Art thou mad, man? A meeting at the palace
of the Adimari! Pompeo Medici there? Why
was this not known sooner? Giulio, thy spies have
misled thee for the once! Why, they were desperate
enemies, in whose feud I placed a deep dependence
for safety. Rinaldo, saidst thou that D’Rossi
was there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mine esquire hath so informed me, please your
grace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the mass, I doubt some treachery. When
Medici and Adimari shake hands, their union is not
to be despised. But thanks at least for this information.
Hark thee, Cerettieri, be it thy care to
look farther into this matter. Arrest this Adimari
and Pino D’Rossi this very night. Away—their
plans shall never be matured! So, gallants, let us
again address ourselves to the festivity of the hour.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The last lingering taper had disappeared from the
windows of the palace, and the clock of the tower
had struck the hour of three, when the figure of a
man might have been descried, cautiously clambering
over the wall which enclosed the ducal gardens.
Passing rapidly through the ornamental parterre, he
stopped beneath a window which opened upon the
gardens, and threw a pebble against the lattice.
The signal having been again repeated, the casement
opened, and a female form advanced upon the
balcony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it thou, Ugolino?” demanded a voice, the
silvery sweetness of whose tone was so clear and
distinct, that it almost startled the count.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is I, dearest Rosabelle,” he replied. “I
have much to communicate with thee, and the
night wanes fast. Throw down the rope, that I
may ascend to thee, for the tidings I have to tell
thee may brook no ears save thine, for whose only
they are intended.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Princess D’Este retired for a moment and
returned, bearing a silken cord, one end of which
she attached to the balcony, and threw the other to
the count. Ugolino ascended, and the princess in a
moment was in his embrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick, let us raise the robe, and close thy
chamber carefully, for I have much to say and
speedily.” With these words they entered the
apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a lofty room, hung with tapestry of Arras,
and sumptuously furnished, as became the rank of
its mistress. Large and costly ottomans, oaken
seats richly carved and ornamented with the armorial
bearings of Brienne, large Venetian mirrors set
in massive frames, and richly chiselled stands of
colored marble, upon which heavy silver candelabra
were placed, added to the magnificence of the
apartment, which was lit by a swinging lamp of
silver, from whence exhaled a delicate perfume.
The count threw himself upon a pile of cushions,
and covered his face with his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ugolino!” said the princess, passing her small
white hand through the curled locks of the count,
“why are you thus agitated? Are we discovered?
Do the blood-hounds of my brother still pursue us?
If so, impart thy griefs to her who adores thee,
that she may, at least, participate in them, if she
cannot console thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am come,” said the count, and a pang of
agony shot across his noble features, “to prove
myself a most foul traitor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Traitor!” said Rosabelle. “Ugolino! can the
name of a traitor associate with thine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye. It can—it must! Thou knowest, Rosabelle,
the price I paid for thee ere now. Thou art
yet doomed to exact from me a sterner sacrifice.
When I saw thee first, the fairest dame in France,
at the gay field of Poictou, I drew in love for thee
with my first breath. Thou wert then the wife of
Julian D’Este. What I suffered for thee then, my
recollection brings too vividly to light. What agonies
I now experience, knowing the barbarous revenge
which my already too deeply oppressed
countryman must undergo, when my tale is told
to the duke—yet all for thy sake—no human imagination
can depict. Then I languished beneath
the load of an affection, which honor, reason, duty,
chivalry, all combined to oppose. Powerless opposition!
The deity of love scorns all defensive
armor. I sought, impelled by fate, the charms of
thy society. For thee, Julian D’Este was no fitting
spouse. Harsh and unrefined, he repelled thine
youthful affections, while I, unhappy, too surely
was the magnet which did attract them. Then
followed our fatal step. Was it folly? My heart
still tells me it is no folly to adore thee. Was it
madness? Madness never spoke in so clear a tone
of reason as in that, which on the day, hallowed
to my remembrance, as we perused that antique
volume, displayed all our feelings—disclosed the
secret emotions of our hearts—gave us soul to soul—and
formed our future bliss—our future woe!
No base and vicious inclinations—no vulgar voluptuousness
disgraced our union. We felt that we
were made for each other, and when Julian D’Este
fell beneath my poniard, I thought it no crime added
to my account, when I endeavored, by compassing
his death, to confer happiness upon thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosabelle answered nought, but hung more devotedly
around the neck of the count, while the
soft blue of her eyes was dimmed with the rising
tear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What ensued—the impossibility of discovering
the murderer of Julian—our farther intercourse—your
brother’s hearty refusal of my suit, and the
suspicion attached to our names, were but matters,
which, had prudence been consulted ere the deed
was done, she would have foretold. But who advises
calmly when the burning fire of love threatens
to consume him? In fine, the tyrant brought thee
with him here to Florence, upon his election as
captain and signor of the city. Here, secluded by
him from the world, I had given thee up as lost.
My faithful Spalatro discovered thy retreat, and as
yet we had hoped that our secret interviews were
undiscovered. Fatal infatuation! This very night
has Pompeo Medici thrown out hints, nay, open
assertions of his knowledge of our situation.
Thanks to the death of Giovanni, else all had
been discovered to the duke!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me counsel thee to fly!” said Rosabelle,
“as I have done before. There is no time to be
lost. Myself will be companion of thy flight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is, I fear, too late. Now listen to the conclusion
of my tale. A great conspiracy is on foot
against the rule of the duke. It will break out
into revolt ere morning. All is prepared. The
fierce Medici swears utter ruin to thy race. Even
though forewarned, I doubt that Gualtieri will be
overwhelmed. Adimari, equally exasperated with
the Medici against thy brother, dare not check
Pompeo in his chase of blood, lest he fall off and
irretrievably ruin the fabric of the conspiracy.
Pino D’Rossi vows death to the minions of the
duke, who, as I am a Christian man, have well
deserved it. Ere day-break, confusion will begin.
Thou must fly to thy brother, and advise him of
the plot. My name must be known as the traitor
to my country, else thy tale will not be believed.
My charge lies at the church of Santa Mario del
Fiore. Ere the palace is invested, do thou devise
means to escape, which may readily be done in the
confusion. Spalatro will conduct thee to the hotel
of San Giovanni, in the Primo Cerchio. There
have I prepared disguises and horses. The chances
of escape then lie before us, and if fortune befriend
us, we will fly to some happier clime. At all
events, death is the worst which can betide us,
and death ends all woes and calms every distress
forever. Art thou willing, my Rosabelle, to trust
thus blindly to fate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosabelle can only live or die with Ugolino!”
cried the princess, throwing herself into the arms of
the count.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Rosabelle, fly to the duke. I hear
already a distant sound—a far murmuring, as of
the gathering of throngs. This last sacrifice, imperious
love, will I make to thee! Remember! the
hotel of San Giovanni! Escape or happy death!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He imprinted an ardent kiss upon the lips of the
beautiful princess, and descending from the balcony
was lost to her sight.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner had Ugolino disappeared, than the
Princess Rosabelle left her apartment, and with
hurried steps rushed along the corridor to the private
chamber of the duke. The soldiers on duty
before the door respectfully resisted the entrance
of the princess, informing her that the duke was
closeted with his principal chiefs, and had strictly
debarred all access to his presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Away!” shrieked the princess, “not speak with
him! I must. It is his life which is at stake!
Ho! Gualtieri! as thou lovest thy life and dukedom,
hear Rosabelle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How now, minion?” said Gualtieri, coming
from the chamber. “Is it not enough that my
daily life must be rendered a curse and a scandal to
me by thy presence and pestilent conduct, but I am
to be disturbed at midnight with thine outcries?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thy life is in danger,” said Rosabelle. “As
thou art a soldier, arm quickly, for ere long they will
be here, who have sworn to see thy heart’s blood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A likely invention!” said the duke, with a
sneer, “by what miracle of evil hast thou arrived
at so sage a conclusion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true, by our lady,” said Rosabelle. “Oh,
Gualtieri, wilt thou not believe me? My brother,
thou hast been harsh to me, but I cannot see thee
murdered without making an effort to save thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Murder, fair Rosabelle,” said the duke, “if all
say true, is by no means unfamiliar to thy thoughts.
How hast thou this rare intelligence? Of what
nature is it? Soldier, retire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adimari and the Medici have plotted the downfall
of thine authority,” replied the princess. “This
night; nay, this very moment their plans will be
matured. The throngs are now gathering which
will hurl thee from thy seat, and perchance, deprive
thee of thy life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From whence thine information?” demanded
the duke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the Count Ugolino.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The face of the duke became purple with rage.
His hands shook like the aspen, and his voice was
hoarse as the growl of the enraged lion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ugolino!” he exclaimed. “Ha! harlot! Hast
thou dared again to discourse with that bloody villain?
and this night? Thou diest for it, wert thou
thrice my sister!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gualtieri drew his dagger, and was about to rush
upon his sister, when the hurried tread of men and
the sound of voices arrested his arm. The dagger
fell from his hand. A door in the corridor flew
violently open, and Cerettieri Visdomini, followed
by three or four soldiers, stood before him. The
face of Visdomini was pale as marble, and a rivulet
of blood, trickling from a deep wound in his forehead,
gave a ghastly expression to his countenance.
His dress was disordered through haste and fright,
and in his hand he bore a broken rapier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How now, Cerettieri?” shouted the duke, while
Rosabelle, taking advantage of the confusion, escaped
from the apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All is confirmed,” replied Visdomini, in a
trembling voice. “The rabble have gained head.
Every thing is in disorder. Your banners are torn
down, and dragged through the filth of the slaughter-houses.
The cross-gules floats with the red lily
every where triumphant. Rally your train, my
lord, and close the palace gates, before the rebels
are upon you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is that traitorous dog, Leonardo Adimari?
Hast not arrested him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did so. He has been rescued, and I bear
nothing from Adimari, save this sword-cut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the Assisi?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have escaped to the palace. They are endeavoring
to rally the troops. Arm, my lord duke,
for the sake of the Madonna, or all is lost!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A loud shout, “down with the tyrant!” and the
clang of arms ran through the corridor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho! D’Argencourt! mine armour! my helmet!”
shouted the duke. “Treason! throw forth
my banner! Stand fast, arbalastmen, to the windows!
Ply trebuchet and mangonel! Cerettieri,
order the Count D’Hunteville to draw forth my
chivalry into the piazza! Shall we shrink from
the hogs of Florence? Fight valiantly, my brave
knights and gallant soldiers, and the spoil of the
city shall be yours!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The streets of Florence presented a wild and
tumultuous scene in the pale gray of the morning.
The bells from the cathedral church of Santa Maria
del Fiore, and from the venerable towers of the
church of the Apostoli, tolled incessantly, while
from the market-place and town-house, as well as
from the multitude of smaller chapels, the din was
fearfully augmented. The shrill cry “to arms!”
resounded every where. From the tall towers of
the noble, from the windows of the citizen’s house—aye,
from hut and hovel, waved the flag of the
ancient republic. The rabble, armed with such
imperfect weapons as haste and rage could supply,
wandered in confused masses through every lane
and thoroughfare, in pursuit of the instruments of
the duke’s cruelty. Armed bands of horsemen patrolled
the city. The burghers of the town, inured
to military discipline, and trained to break opposing
squadrons with the spear, were ranged, each man
under the respective banner of his ward. Barriers
were thrown up at the end of every street to break
the charge of the duke’s cavalry. Adimari and the
Medici rode at the head of their mailed retainers,
displaying their armorial bearings, through every
ward, cheering and animating the citizens. The
ducal soldiery, scattered through the city, and unprepared
for such an emergency, were endeavoring
to regain the palace, but many were seized and
stripped of their armour, by the vigilance of Pino
D’Rossi and his associates. In front of the palace
was collected a blood-thirsty mob, in overwhelming
numbers, pouring from lane and alley, among which
cross bows and mangonels of the soldiery from the
windows, scarce seemed to take effect, so fast were
those who fell replaced by throngs of the living. The
cry of “death! death!” was yelled out on every
hand. Women thronged the windows of the
grand square, repeating the cry, and throwing
weapons to the crowd below. Many of the lesser
minions of the duke were seized; some in female
apparel, endeavoring to escape, were rent in
pieces by the vindictive Florentines, with circumstances
of horrible ferocity. In the height of the
uproar, a knight, mounted upon a barbed steed,
and covered with a gold and ivory pointed shield,
his page being seated behind him, was seen dashing
along at full speed toward the city gates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho!” cried Bindo Altoviti, “what guard keep
ye here, archers? Draw to the head, and send
me yon Frenchman back to his own country,
feathered for his flight with a goose-wing of Florence!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shower of arrows were directed against the
fugitives, two of which took effect, and the knight,
with his page, fell to the ground. The people pursued
and caught the flying steed, crying, “thanks
to the good duke for the gift! Oh! the Florentine
people for ever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adimari and Medici, with their train, rode up at
the instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What cavalier is yon?” asked Adimari. “Some
one examine him, that we may know if he deserve
honorable burial. God forbid we should deny that,
even to a foe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pompeo Medici rode up, attended by an esquire,
to the bodies, and dismounting, unlaced the helmet
of the fallen cavalier, across whom the body of the
page was extended, as if to protect the form of his
master. The dying man turned his countenance to
Medici, and with a shudder, fell back dead in an
unavailing effort to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! St. John! whom have we here?” cried
Pompeo. “Noble Adimari, view these corpses.
My thoughts were not in error. And the page
too—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the cross of St. Peter!” said Adimari, “it is
no other than the Count Ugolino, and the page is—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosabelle De Brienne.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A deep cloud of sorrow shaded the countenance
of Adimari.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By San Giovanni!” said he, “I sorely mistrusted
this. This is that love, stronger than death.
Noble Ugolino, an ill-fate hath attended thee! This
then hast been the cause of thy desertion, but, by
my faith, I cannot blame thee, for thy lady hast the
fairest face I ever looked upon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace be with their souls!” said Medici.
“Death ends all feuds. Cover their faces, and see
that they be laid, side by side, in the chapel of the
Virgin, with such ceremonies as their high stations
demand. Myself shall be, if I live, chief mourner
at this burial. Donato, be it thy care to have their
bodies conveyed to the Convent of Mercy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The siege of the palace continued from day to
day. Famine began to gnaw the vitals of the
French soldiery, and fixed her tooth, sharper than
the sword, beneath each iron cuirass. Rage without
and hunger within, popular clamor and mutinous
murmurings, accumulated the distress of the
duke. In this emergency, he sent the Comte
D’Hunteville, his almost only virtuous follower, to
intercede with the Florentines, and to make honorable
terms of capitulation. Adimari would hearken
to no proposals, unless Giulio and Ippolito D’Assisi,
and Cerettieri Visdomini, the chief agents of oppression,
were delivered into the hands of the
people. Gualtieri, impelled by a sense of honor,
refused to accede to this demand. Thrice did the
chief of the <span class='it'>balia</span>, the bishop, and the Siennese
envoys, urge to the duke the impossibility of maintaining
the palace, and the necessity of complying
with the popular will. They met with reiterated
denial. The soldiers then sent a corporal to entreat
the duke to submission. Their suit was dismissed
with scorn. Then did the soldiers crowd,
with frowning faces and clashing arms, the chamber
of the duke, with the memorable words, “lord duke,
choose between these three heads and your own.”
Urged by imperious necessity, worn out with famine,
and watching, and clamor, Gualtieri, at last,
gave a tacit acquiescence to the delivery of his
favorites, and the pangs which his proud spirit felt
at this ignominious humiliation were far more bitter
than any of the tortures which he had inflicted upon
the objects of his tyranny. Shall I record the doom
of the victims? Is it not written in the chronicles
of the Florentine republic? They were torn in
pieces by the howling multitude, and their flesh actually
devoured, even while their palpitating limbs
were quivering in the agonies of death!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quiet was once more restored to the city by
the expulsion of the duke and his followers. The
chapel of the Convent of Mercy, hung with black,
and faintly lighted by dim and funeral tapers, was
prepared for the last death rites of Ugolino and of
his lady. Around the bier, where reposed the
coffined forms of the dead, were gathered the
noblest of Florence, and crowds of the common
sort thronged the sacred edifice. The last notes
of the pealing requiem died away. The solemn
priest sprinkled the holy water, and the last prayer
for the dead passed from his lips. The rites were
ended, and amid the tears of that noble assemblage
the marble jaws of the tomb closed for ever upon
the bodies of those, in whom love had indeed been
stronger than death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still does their sad tale exist among the legends
of Florence, and the youths and maidens of that
ancient town yet consecrate a tear to the inscription
which records the loves and fate of Count
Ugolino and of Rosabelle De Brienne. Yet indeed
“death can only take away the sorrowful from our
affections: the flower expands: the colorless film
that enveloped it falls off and perishes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>You</span> never knew Agnes? She was the prettiest
girl in the village, or, for that matter, within a circuit
of twenty miles. At the time I write of, she
was just budding into womanhood, and if ever there
was a lovely being, she was one at eighteen. Her
eyes were blue, not of that light blue which is so
unmeaning, but of the deep azure tint of a midnight
sky, when a thousand stars are shining on its
bosom, and you feel a mysterious spell cast upon
you as you gaze on high. Just so I felt whenever
Agnes would look into my eyes with those deep
blue orbs of hers, whose every glance thrilled me to
the soul. And then her hair. It was the poet’s
color—a rich, sun-shiny gold. How I loved to
gaze upon its massy tresses, as they flowed down a
neck unrivalled for shape and whiteness. In figure
she was like a sylph. Her voice excelled in sweetness
any I had ever heard. It was low, and soft,
and musical as the whisper of an angel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Agnes and I had grown up together. We were
not relatives, but we were both wards of Mr. Stanley,
and had been playmates in childhood. Many
a time had we spent whole days in wandering
across our guardian’s grounds, now threading the
old wood, now loitering by the little stream, and
now plucking buttercups to hold under each other’s
chins. Ah! those were pleasant hours. And as
we grew up, and were separated,—she remaining
at home with her governess, and I going to an
eastern college,—I would sit for hours dreaming of
Agnes, and wondering if she ever thought of me.
I know not how it was; but for years I looked
upon her as I looked on no other of her sex, and
at the age when youth is most susceptible to novelty,
I remained true to Agnes, as to the star of
my destiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I returned, after a long absence of six years, to
the residence of my guardian. In all that time I
had not seen Agnes. How I longed to ascertain
whether she had changed since we parted, and
during the whole of the last stage of my journey, I
lay back in the carriage, wondering in what manner
she would meet. And when the vehicle stopped at
the door of Mr. Stanley’s mansion, and all the remembered
scenes of my childhood crowded around
me, I turned from them impatiently, and, with a
throbbing heart, looked among the group awaiting
me, to see if I could distinguish Agnes. That gray-haired,
gentlemanly man I knew to be my second
father; but was the surpassingly beautiful girl at
his side my old playmate? My heart beat quick;
a sudden tremor seized me; my head was for a
moment dizzy, as I advanced hastily up the steps,
and was clasped, the next instant, in Mr. Stanley’s
arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear—dear boy, God bless you!” said the
kind-hearted old gentleman. “We see you once
more amongst us. But have you forgotten your
old play-fellow?” he continued, turning to the fair
creature at his side. “Six years make a great
alteration I know. Agnes don’t you remember
Henry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I turned and fixed my eyes full upon her, I
caught Agnes examining me with eager curiosity.
Detected in her scrutiny she blushed to the very
forehead, and dropped her eyes suddenly to the
ground. I was equally abashed. I had approached
her intending to address her with my old familiarity,
but this aversion of her look somehow unaccountably
disheartened me. I hesitated whether I should
offer her my hand. The embarrassment was becoming
oppressive, when, with a desperate effort, I
extended my hand, and said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Agnes—” but for the life of me I could
not proceed. It was, however, sufficient to induce
her to look up, and our eyes met. At the same
instant she took my proffered hand. What happened
afterward I could never remember, only I recollect
the blood rushed in torrents to my cheeks, and I
fancied that the tiny white hand I held in my own,
trembled a little, a very little, but still trembled.
When I woke from the delirium of indescribable
emotions that ensued, I found myself sitting with
my guardian and Agnes in the parlor, but whether
I walked there on my head or my feet I cannot to
this day remember.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The month which followed was among the happiest
of my life, for it was spent at the side of
Agnes. We walked, rode, chatted, and sang together;
not a morning or an evening found us
apart; and insensibly her presence became to me
almost as necessary as the air I breathed. Yet—I
know not how it was—Agnes was a mystery to
me. At first, indeed, we were almost on the same
footing as if we had been brother and sister, but
after I had been at my guardian’s about a month,
she began to grow reserved, although at times she
would display all her old frankness, united with even
more than her usual gaiety. Often too, when I
looked up at her suddenly, I would find her gazing
into my face, and when thus detected, she would
blush and cast her eyes down, and seem so embarrassed
that I scarcely knew what to think, unless
it was that Agnes—but no!—how could she be in
love with one almost a stranger?</p>

<p class='pindent'>For myself, I would have given the world, if I
could only have penetrated the secrets of her heart,
and learned there whether the affection toward her,
which I had felt had stolen almost insensibly across
me, had been returned. Yes! I would have given
an emperor’s ransom to discover what my timidity
would not allow me to enquire. It is an old story,
and has been told by hundreds before—this tale of
a young lover—but I cannot refrain from rehearsing
it again. I was sadly perplexed. Not a day passed
but what I rose to the height of hope, or fell to the
depth of despair. A smile from Agnes was the
sunlight of my existence, and her reserve plunged
me in unfathomable darkness. I could not penetrate
the fickleness of her manner, especially when
any of her young female friends were visiting her.
If I spoke to them with any show of interest, she
would either be unnaturally gay or singularly silent,
and when I came to address her, I would be received
with chilling coldness. Yet, at other times, my
despair would be relieved by a return of her old
frankness, and a hundred times have I been on the
point of telling her the whole story of my love, but
either my fears, or her returning reserve, prevented
my purpose from being executed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, after I had been at my guardian’s for
nearly three months, Agnes and I set out together
for a walk through the forest. It was a beautiful
morning, and the birds were carolling gaily from
every bough, while the balmy wind sighed sweetly
among the fresh forest leaves, making together a
harmony such as nothing but nature herself, on a
morning so lovely, can produce. Our hearts were
in unison with the scenery around, and Agnes was
in one of her old frank moods. We wandered on
accordingly, over stream and through glade and
down dell, admiring the glorious scenery on every
hand, and now and then stopping to gather a wild
flower, to listen to the birds, or to rest upon some
mossy bank, until the day had far advanced, and
recurring, for the first time to my watch, I found
that we had been several hours on our stroll, and
that it was already high noon. We were not so
far, however, from home but what we might reach
it in an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had we not better return, Agnes?” said I, “it
is growing late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! yes,” she replied, “in a moment. Wait
till I have finished this wreath,” and she continued
weaving together the wild flowers she had gathered
for a chaplet for her hair. How nimbly her taper
fingers moved, and how lovely she looked, as seated
on the grassy knoll, with her hat cast off beside
her, and her beautiful face flushed with health and
pleasure, she pursued her task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was still busy in her fanciful labor, when
a cloud suddenly obscured the sun, and we both
looked up in some surprise, for the morning had
been unusually fair, and not a vapor hitherto had
dimmed the sky. A light fleecy film like a fine
gauze veil, was floating across the sun’s disc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a storm brewing in the hills,” said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us return at once,” said Agnes, “for my
chaplet is finished at last, and it would be so dreadful
to be caught in a shower.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We did not linger a moment, for we both knew
that it was not unusual for a thunder shower to
come up, in that mountainous region, with a rapidity
almost inconceivable to those who have never lived
in so elevated a position. Hastily seizing her hat,
and throwing her chaplet over her bright brow, she
set forth smiling as gaily as ever, to return by the
shortest path to our home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For nearly a half an hour we pursued our way
through the forest, but at every step we perceived
that the storm was coming up more rapidly, until
at length the smiles of Agnes ceased, and we pursued
our now hurried way in silence, save when
an exclamation from my fair companion betokened
some new and angrier aspect of the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Harry,” she said, at length, “we shall get
drenched through—see, the tempest is at hand, and
we have yet more than a mile to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked up. The storm was indeed at our
doors. Yet it was as magnificent a spectacle as I
had ever beheld. The heavens were as black as
pitch, save now and then when for a moment they
were obscured by a lurid canopy of dust, swept
upward from the highway, giving earth and sky the
appearance as of the day of doom. Now the wind
wailed out in the forest, and now whirled wildly
past us. The trees groaned and bent in the gale,
their branches streaming out like banners on the
air. Anon, all was still. How deep and awful
and seemingly endless was that boding repose.
Agnes shrank closer to my side, her face paler
than ashes, and her slight form trembling with
ill-concealed agitation. Not a house was in sight.
I saw that our only shelter was the forest, and I
retreated, therefore, beneath a huge overshadowing
oak, whose gnarled and aged branches might have
defied a thousand years. As I did so a few rain
drops pattered heavily to the earth—then came
another silence—and then with a rushing-sound
through the forest, as if an army was at hand, the
tempest was upon us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never had I beheld such a storm. It seemed
as if earth and heaven had met in battle, and that
each was striving amid the ruins of a world for the
mastery. The first rush of the descending rain
was like a deluge, bending the mightiest trees like
reeds beneath it, and filling the hollows of the
forest road with a flood of water. Suddenly a
vivid flash of lightning shot across the heaven, and
then at a short interval followed a clap of thunder.
Agnes clung closely to my arm, her face wild with
affright. With a few hurried words I strove to
sooth her, pressing her still closer, and with
strange delight, to my bosom. As I did so she
burst into tears. Her conduct—I cannot explain
why—filled me with a joy I had long despaired of,
and in the impulse of the moment, I said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Agnes! fear not. I am beside you, and
will die with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up, all tearful as she was, into my
eyes, and strove to speak, but her emotion was
too great, and, with a glance I shall never forget,
buried her face against my shoulder. I pressed
her closer to my heart. I felt a wild ecstacy
tingling through every vein, such as I had never
experienced. I could not resist my feelings longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Agnes! dear, dear Agnes,” I said, bending
over her, “<span class='it'>I love you.</span> Oh! will you be mine if
we escape?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made me no answer, but sobbed aloud. I
pressed her hand. The pressure was gently returned.
I wanted nothing more to assure me of
her affection. I was in a dream of wildering
delight at the conviction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment I had forgotten the tempest in
my ecstacy. But suddenly I was aroused from
my rapture by a succession of loud and reiterated
peals, bursting nearer and nearer overhead, and I
looked up now in real alarm, wishing that we had
kept the forest road, exposed as we would have
been to the rain, rather than subject ourselves to
the dangers of our present position. I determined
even yet to fly from our peril, and taking Agnes by
the waist, urged her trembling steps onward. We
had but escaped from beneath the oak when a
blinding flash of lightning zig-zagged from one
horizon to the other, and instantaneously a peal
of thunder, which rings in my ears even yet, burst
right over us, and went crackling and echoing
down the sky, as if a thousand chariots were
driving furiously over its adamantine pavement.
But this I scarcely noticed at the time, though it
filled my memory afterward, for the flash of lightning
seeming to dart from every quarter of the
heaven, and unite right over us, shot directly
downward, and in the next instant the oak under
which we had been standing, riven in twain, stood
a scarred and blackened wreck, against the frowning
sky. I felt my senses reeling: I thought all
was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I recovered my senses I found myself
standing, with Agnes in my arms, while the thunder
was still rolling down the firmament. My first
thought was of the dear girl beside me, for I
thought her form was unusually heavy. She was
apparently perfectly lifeless. Oh! the agony of
that moment! Could she have been struck by the
lightning? Wild with fear I exclaimed,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Agnes! look up—dear one, you are not hurt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length she moved. She had only fainted, and
the rain revived her, so that in a few minutes I had
the inexpressible delight of feeling her clasp my
hand in return for my ardent emotion. But it was
long before she was able to return home, and when
we did so we arrived thoroughly drenched through.
But every thing was forgotten in gratitude for our
escape, and joy at knowing that we were beloved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Agnes is now my wife, and I hear her
footstep, still to me like music, approaching. I
must close my sketch or the dear one will burn it,
for she has no notion, she says, of figuring in a
magazine.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>THE UNCERTAINTY OF ITS APPRECIATION.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY JOSEPH EVANS SNODGRASS.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>There</span> is nothing more uncertain than the nature
of the reception a Poet’s productions, and particularly
his shortest pieces, are destined to meet.
Especially is this true with respect to the more
egotistical sort of versifications—such as sonnets,
and the like—in which one’s own feelings find vent
in verses penned, perhaps, for an album, or intended
for the perusal of the immediate circle in which the
writer moves. Now, the appreciation of sentiments
thus embodied, when they come to be <span class='it'>volume-ized</span>,
depends entirely upon the mood of mind in which
they find the reader. Such is, indeed, the case
with <span class='it'>personal</span> thoughts, even when they appear
amid the popular literature of the day—but is more
strikingly so under the circumstances named. If a
sonnet, for example, which has been addressed to
some real or fancied idol of the heart, falls into the
hands of one who is under the influence of the
tender passion, it is sure to be fully appreciated, and
pronounced “beautiful.” To such an one, nothing
is too sentimental.<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a> Anything which tells of the
“trials of the heart”—of “true love”—of a “broken
heart”—is doubly welcome. If it have a sprinkle
of star-and-moon-sentiment about it, all the better.
But place a piece of poetry headed, “Sonnet to
the Moon,” or “To Mary,” before a heartless old
bachelor, or an unsentimental matron, and the exclamation
would be—“what nonsense—what stuff!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is not only in the case of the love-struck,
and the <span class='it'>sans-love</span> portions of the community, that
the uncertainty named is made manifest, by any
means. The most thoughtful and dignified productions
may be the recipients of censure, for want of
a <span class='it'>kindredness</span> of sentimentality—or absence of it—on
the part of the reader. The mind may be totally
unfitted for the thoughts before it, by very conformation,—or
what is the same thing in effect—from
habit. And, then again, the mind of the most
sentimental order by nature, may be placed under
unfavorable circumstances to appreciate the thoughts
of the poet. So much so, that the most beautiful
creations of the most fanciful author, may be as
sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal, though
clothed in most harmonious numbers. How, for
instance, may we expect the merchant or mechanic,
wearied with the toils of the day, to peruse a poem,
however short, with the same pleasure and favorable
reception as the man of leisure? The thing is
among the impossibles. But even the man of taste
and leisure, may fail (nay, often does,) to enter into
the feelings of the writer—and without <span class='it'>feeling</span> the
appreciation and penning of poetry, are, alike, out
of the question—unless we except some of the
poetry of <span class='sc'>Pope</span> and others, which has left the ordinary
track. It is so exceedingly difficult to catch
the nice shades of meaning which it is intended to
express, unless assisted by the heart. Poetical
<span class='it'>allusions</span> especially, are always liable to be mistaken,
if not scanned with a poetic eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is the change of circumstances which
often, more than aught else, prevents the comprehension
and appreciation of a poet’s thoughts—his
descriptive thoughts particularly. As much as descriptive
poetry resembles painting, it comes far
short of the power which the latter art exerts in
representing scenes <span class='it'>as a whole</span>. Take a pastoral
poem, by way of making my meaning understood.
A poet would describe the parts and personages
separately—such as the wood,—the stream,—the
flocks, and the pastoral lovers—but the painter can
present them all at once, as a single idea, so to
speak. How difficult, then, must it be for an
author so to describe scenes, the like of which the
reader may never have beheld, as to be fully appreciated
by all. If he is sketching,—as did Thompson,—the
customs and scenes of rural life, he will
be understood fully by those alone who have enjoyed
such scenes and practised such customs. Those
who, in this case, had viewed the <span class='it'>original</span>, would
be able best to decide upon the merits of the picture.
A poet might rhyme forever about scenes
which he had never looked upon, but he would
utterly fail to satisfy one familiar with the same,
that his portraitures were correct. So a reader,
who had never viewed a river, or a waterfall, or a
gloomy ravine amid rock-ribbed mountains, would
scarcely be able fully to appreciate a description of
the same. He might, indeed form an idea of the
reality—but it would be only <span class='it'>ideal</span> after all. I have
often thought of Byron’s exclamation in connection
with the above train of reflections:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Oh! there is sweetness in the mountain’s air,</p>
<p class='line0'>Which bloated ease can never hope to share.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>He was probably among the hills of Portugal at the
time, and, doubtless, felt what he wrote. I never
realized the force of the thought as I did one summer
morning, while seated in a piazza, a half mile
or so from the North Mountain, in my native Virginia,
with a beautiful, green and flowery meadow
intervening. Just as I came to the stanza of
“Childe Harold,” from which I have quoted, a
delightful mountain-breeze swept over the plain. As
it tossed my locks to and fro, and gamboled with
the leaves of the volume before me, I <span class='it'>felt</span> indeed,
that there was “sweetness in the mountain air.”
Nothing could set forth that uncertainty of appreciation
I have been dwelling upon, more clearly
than such an incident. It is probable that the
greatest city admirer of his lordship’s poetry, never
noticed the full force of the idea which thus arrested
my attention, but passed it unappreciated, in admiration
of some sentiment, in the very same stanza,
whose full import he could comprehend, while he
entered into the feelings of the poetic traveller.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the greatest difficulty with the “occasional”
as well as shorter pieces of a volume of poems, is
the difference between the circumstances under
which they were severally penned, and those under
which they are perused. One reads, in the self-same
hour, the diversified productions of years.
How, then, can a writer anticipate the appreciation
of his sentiments? He has ceased to enter into
his <span class='it'>own</span> peculiar, circumstance-generated emotions.
How, therefore, may others take his views? To
suppose an ability on the part of the critic, to do
justice, then, to the earlier and less-studied <span class='it'>morceaux</span>,
(or, as I have styled them above, the egotistical
pieces of an author,) would be to suppose an utter
impossibility—a sort of critical <span class='it'>ubiquity</span>. Coleridge
felt the truth of what I have advanced,—as any one
may learn from the preface of his “Juvenile
Poems.” He therein expresses his apprehensions
in the following language:—“I shall only add, that
each of my readers will, I hope, remember that
these poems, on various subjects, which he reads at
one time, and under the influence of one set of
feelings, were written at different times, and
prompted by very different feelings; and, therefore,
the inferiority of one poem to another, may, sometimes,
be owing to the temper of mind in which he
happens to peruse it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What shall we say, then? Shall an author abstain
from publishing his shorter and occasional
pieces, on account of the facts alluded to by Coleridge?
By no means, I would say, though a consideration
thereof may well deter the judicious
writer from admitting into his volume every thing
he may have penned. As to the dimensions of
pieces, it may be more advisable, in some cases, to
republish the shortest sonnets, and the like, relating
to one’s own personal feelings and relations, than
longer productions—at least they are likely to be
more pleasing to the general reader. They are
unquestionably useful, as throwing light upon points
of a man’s private history with a force of illumination
which no biographer could use, were he to
attempt it—a something, by-the-bye, which seldom
happens; indicating the probability, that we seldom
read <span class='it'>the</span> man’s real biography, but merely <span class='it'>a</span> man’s—often
an ideal man only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the effect of fugitive and earlier poems,
when republished, upon an author’s reputation—let
them be appreciated or not, it matters little. His
fame does not hang upon such “slender threads.”
It is to his more elaborate productions that the
public will look for evidences of genius. It is a
fact that a poet’s reputation, generally speaking,
depends upon the appreciation of some particular
production. It is true, readers may differ in their
assignment of merit—but the fact of non-agreement,
as to the question of comparative merit, does
not alter the principle. If each one comes to the
conclusion that the poet has penned <span class='it'>one</span> poem of
prime excellence, his name is safe—the residue are
set down not as evidences of a want of genius, but
of the neglect of a right and careful use of it. The
conclusion is, in other words, that he could have
written the others better, if he had made proper
use of the talents with which he was endowed.
Were an example needed, I might refer to Milton.
When we think of him we never associate with his
name any of his productions but “Paradise Lost.”
He might have published in the same volume thousands
of fugitive pieces, no better than those he did
suffer to see the light, (and they are with few exceptions,
poor enough, as the emanations of such a
mind,) and yet his fame not suffer in the smallest
degree—the names of Milton, and of that great poem,
would still have descended as one and inseparable.</p>

<div><h1><a id='sport'></a>SPORTS AND PASTIMES.</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>HUNTING DOGS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>We</span> said, in our last, that no sport could be attained
without <span class='it'>good</span> dogs. The first dog, and the very best
for the sportsman, is <span class='it'>the Pointer</span>. All our pointers
are, in some degree, of Spanish extraction; and such
of them as have the most Spanish blood in their veins
are unquestionably the best. The Spanish pointer is
about twenty-one inches in height. He has a large
head, is heavily made, broad-chested, stout-limbed,
with a large dew-lap; his eyes are full, and widely
apart, and his nose is broad; his tail is straight, short,
and thick, and his ears large, pendulous, and fine; he
should have a round-balled and not a flat foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The most essential point about the dog,” says
General Hanger, “is a good foot; for, without a good,
firm foot, he can never hunt long. I never look at a
dog which has a thin, flat, wide, and spread foot. As
long as the ground is dry and hard, I always wash my
dog’s feet with warm soap and water, and clean them
well, particularly between the toes and balls of the
feet; this comforts his feet, allays the heat, and promotes
the circulation in the feet. In the more advanced
period of the season, when the ground is very
wet, then salt and water may be proper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely two pointers are to be seen so much alike,
that a naturalist would pronounce them to belong to
the same class of dogs, inasmuch as they are dissimilar
in size, weight, and appearance. We recognise
only two pointers—the Spaniard and the mongrel.
Nearly all the pointers we see are, in fact, mongrels,
although each may have more or less of the original
Spanish blood. Such, however, is the force of nature,
that a dog, having in him very little of the blood of
the pointer, may prove a very serviceable dog to the
shooter. We frequently meet with very good dogs—dogs
deemed by their owners first-rate—which bear
little resemblance, in point of shape and appearance,
to the true pointer; some of these have the sharp
nose of the fox, others the snubbed nose of the bull-dog;
in short, there is every diversity in size and
appearance from the greyhound to the pug. The
excellence of such dogs must be attributed to judicious
treatment, severe discipline, or having been constantly
out with a good shot, or in company with highly-trained
dogs. It is, however, a mistake to suppose
that they are of a proper strain to breed from. Their
offspring will be deformed, and will probably manifest
some of the worst and more hidden qualities of
the parents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attempt to lay down a written rule whereby to
distinguish between a good and an indifferent pointer,
would be futile. How much of the blood of the
pointer a dog has in him, will be read in his countenance,
rather than inferred from his general shape
and appearance. There is an indescribable something
in the countenance of a thorough-bred pointer, which
a little habit of observation will enable the sportsman
to detect with tolerable accuracy, so that he may
judge of the capabilities of a dog, as a physiognomist
will read at a glance a person’s disposition and ability
in his countenance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The instinct of pointing, we apprehend, is an indestructible
principle in the blood of the pointer, which,
however that blood may be mingled with inferior
blood, will always, in some degree, manifest itself;
and on this ground we build our theory, that the farther
any dog is removed from the original Spanish
pointer, the worse the dog is; and, consequently, that
all attempts to cross the pointer with any other blood
must necessarily deteriorate the breed. The greyhound
is seldom or never crossed to give him additional
fleetness, nor the hound to improve his nose;
why then should the pointer be crossed with dogs
which, in so far as the sports of the field are concerned,
scarcely inherit one quality in common with
him? Attempts, however, are constantly made to
improve the pointer, by a cross with the blood-hound,
fox-hound, Newfoundland dog, or mastiff, sometimes
with a view of improving his appearance, and bringing
him to some fancied standard of perfection; but,
in reality, inducing a deformity. One of these imaginary
standards of perfection is, that to one part
thorough Spanish blood, the pointer should have in
him an eighth of the fox-hound, and a sixteenth of the
blood-hound. A cross will sometimes produce dogs
which are, in some eyes, the <span class='it'>beau idéal</span> of beauty;
but however handsome such dogs may be, they will
necessarily possess some quality not belonging to the
pointer. A thorough-bred pointer carries his head
well up when ranging; he will not give tongue, nor
has he much desire to chase footed game. The hound
pointer may be sometimes detected by his coarse ears,
by his tail being curled upwards, and being carried
high, or by his rough coat. An occasional cross with
the mastiff or Newfoundland dog, is said to increase
the fineness of nose, but it is converting the pointer
into a mere retriever. Another, and the main source
of the unsightliness of sporting dogs, is the allowing
an indiscriminate intercourse between pointers and
setters. Good dogs may be thus obtained sometimes,
but they are invariably mis-shapen; they have generally
the head and brush tail of the setter, with the
body of the pointer, and their coats are not sleek,
and instead of standing at their point, they will crouch.
When the sire is nearly thorough-bred, dogs of a superior
description, but certainly not the best, are
sometimes produced by the Newfoundland or some
other not strictly a pointer. We are not willing to
allow that the pointer is improved in any quality that
renders him valuable to the sportsman, by a cross
with the hound or any other sort of dog; though we
cannot deny that the setter is materially improved in
appearance by a cross with the Newfoundland, but
what it gains in appearance it loses in other respects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Breeding mongrels, especially crossing with hounds,
has given the gamekeepers and dog-breakers an infinity
of trouble, which might have been avoided by
keeping the blood pure. The Spanish pointer seldom
requires the whip; the hound pointer has never
enough of it. One of the main sources of the sportsman’s
pleasure is to see the dogs point well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dogs should be constantly shot over during the
season by a successful shot, and exercised during the
shooting recess by some person who understands
well the management of them, otherwise they will
fall off in value—the half-bred ones will become unmanageable,
and even the thorough-bred ones will
acquire disorderly habits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We look upon the setter to be an inferior kind of
pointer perhaps; originally a cross between the pointer
and the spaniel, or some such dog as the Newfoundland,
for it has some qualities in common with each.
The pointer has the finer nose, and is more staunch
than the setter; his action is much finer. Pointers
are averse to water; setters delight in it. The setter
will face briars and bushes better than the pointer,
which is in this respect a tender dog; and for this
reason the setter is preferred to the pointer for cover-shooting.
Besides, his being not so staunch as the
pointer is an additional advantage in heavy covers.
The sportsman who shoots over well-broken pointers,
frequently passes game in woods, while the pointers,
which are not seen by him, are at their point; the
setter, being more impatient to run in, affords the
shooter many shots in cover, which the over-staunch
pointer would not. The pointer is always to be preferred
on open grounds. In hot weather the pointer
will endure more fatigue than the setter.</p>

<hr class='tbk127'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The Spaniel, Cock Dog, or Springer.</span>—Spaniels are
the best dogs for beating covers, provided they can
be kept near the gun. They are generally expected
to give tongue when game is flushed: some Spaniels
will give notice of game before it rises, which is very
well where woodcocks only are expected to be found.
Woodcock and pheasant shooting are often combined;
when that is the case, a noisy cry is not desirable:
pheasant shooting cannot be conducted too quietly,
where covers are limited. Wherever the underwood
is so thick that the shooter cannot keep his eye on
the dogs, spaniels are to be preferred to pointers or
setters, whatever species of game the shooter may be
in pursuit of. When spaniels are brought to such a
state of discipline as to be serviceable in an open
country, they will require no further tutoring to fit
them for the woods, unless it be that the eye of their
master not being always on them, they begin to ramble.
The efficiency of the training of spaniels for
cover-shooting, depends, for the most part, on their
keeping near the shooter; for if they riot, they are
the worst dogs he can hunt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is much less trouble in making a spaniel
steady than at first thought may be imagined. A puppy
eight months old, introduced among three or four
well-broken dogs, is easily taught his business. The
breaker should use him to a cord of twenty yards
length or so, before he goes into the field, and then
take him out with the pack. Many a young dog is
quiet and obedient from the first; another is shy, and
stares and runs about as much at the rising of the
birds as the report of the gun. Shortly he gets over
this, and takes a part in the sport—he then begins to
chase, but finding he is not followed after little birds
or game, he returns; and should he not, and commence
hunting out of shot, which is very likely, he
must be called in, and flogged or rated, as his temper
calls for. With care and patience, he will soon “pack
up” with the others, especially if that term is used
when the dogs are dividing; and if not, he may be
checked by treading on the cord, and rated or beaten
as his fault requires. Spaniels will, in general, stand
more whipping than other dogs, but care must be
taken not to be lavish or severe with it at first, or the
dog becomes cowed, and instead of hunting will sneak
along at heel.</p>

<hr class='tbk128'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The Retriever.</span>—The business of the retriever is to
find lost game. Newfoundland dogs are the best for
the purpose. They should have a remarkably fine
sense of smelling, or they will be of little use in tracing
a wounded pheasant, or other game, through a
thick cover, where many birds have been running
about. A good retriever will follow the bird on whose
track he is first put, as a blood-hound will that of a
human being or deer. He should be taught to bring
his game, or in many instances his finding a wounded
bird would be of no advantage to the shooter.</p>

<hr class='tbk129'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Kennel Treatment.</span>—The best regular food for
sporting dogs is oatmeal well boiled, and flesh, which
may be either boiled with the meal or given raw. In
hot weather, dogs should not have either oatmeal or
flesh in a raw state, as they are heating. Potatoes
boiled are good summer food, and an excellent occasional
variety in winter, but they should be cleaned
before being boiled, and <span class='it'>well dried</span> after, or they will
produce disease. Roasted potatoes are equally good,
if not better. The best food to bring dogs into condition,
and to preserve their wind in hot weather, is
sago boiled to a jelly, half a pound of which may be
given to each dog daily, in addition to potatoes or
other light food; a little flesh meat, or a few bones,
being allowed every alternate day. Dogs should have
whey or buttermilk two or three times a week during
summer, when it can be procured, or in lieu thereof,
should have a table-spoonful of flour of sulphur once
a fortnight. To bring a dog into condition for the
season, we would give him a very large table-spoonful
of sulphur about a fortnight before the 12th of August,
and two days after giving him that, a full table-spoonful
of syrup of buckthorn should be administered, and
afterwards twice repeated at intervals of three days,
the dog being fed on the sago diet the while. There
should always be fresh water within reach. Dogs
should never be chained up.</p>

<div><h1><a id='new'></a>REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS.</h1></div>

<hr class='tbk131'/>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>“Critical and Miscellaneous Essays.” By T. Babington
Macaulay. Vol. 3d. Carey &amp; Hart: Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Macaulay has obtained a reputation which, although
deservedly great, is yet in a remarkable measure undeserved.
The few who regard him merely as a
terse, forcible and logical writer, full of thought, and
abounding in original views often sagacious and never
otherwise than admirably expressed—appear to us
precisely in the right. The many who look upon him
as not only all this, but as a comprehensive and profound
thinker, little prone to error, err essentially
themselves. The source of the general mistake lies
in a very singular consideration—yet in one upon
which we do not remember ever to have heard a word
of comment. We allude to a tendency in the public
mind towards logic for logic’s sake—a liability to
confound the vehicle with the conveyed—an aptitude
to be so dazzled by the luminousness with which an
idea is set forth, as to mistake it for the luminousness
of the idea itself. The error is one exactly analogous
with that which leads the immature poet to think
himself sublime wherever he is obscure, because obscurity
is a source of the sublime—thus confounding
obscurity of expression with the expression of obscurity.
In the case of Macaulay—and we may say, <span class='it'>en
passant</span>, of our own Channing—we assent to what he
says, too often because we so very clearly understand
what it is that he intends to say. Comprehending
vividly the points and the sequence of his argument,
we fancy that we are concurring in the argument itself.
It is not every mind which is at once able to
analyze the satisfaction it receives from such Essays
as we see here. If it were merely <span class='it'>beauty</span> of style for
which they were distinguished—if they were remarkable
only for rhetorical flourishes—we would not be
apt to estimate these flourishes at more than their due
value. We would not agree with the doctrines of
the essayist on account of the elegance with which
they were urged. On the contrary, we would be inclined
to disbelief. But when all ornament save that
of simplicity is disclaimed—when we are attacked by
precision of language, by perfect accuracy of expression,
by directness and singleness of thought, and
above all by a logic the most rigorously close and
consequential—it is hardly a matter for wonder that
nine of us out of ten are content to rest in the gratification
thus received as in the gratification of absolute
truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the terseness and simple vigor of Macaulay’s
style it is unnecessary to point out instances. Every
one will acknowledge his merits on this score. His
exceeding <span class='it'>closeness</span> of logic, however, is more especially
remarkable. With this he suffers nothing to
interfere. Here, for example, is a sentence in which,
to preserve entire the chain of his argument—<span class='it'>to leave
no minute gap which the reader might have to fill up
with thought</span>—he runs into most unusual tautology.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The books and traditions of a sect may contain,
mingled with propositions strictly theological, other
propositions, purporting to rest on the same authority,
which relate to physics. If new discoveries should
throw discredit on the physical propositions, the
theological propositions, unless they can be separated
from the physical propositions, will share in their
discredit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These things are very well in their way; but it is
indeed questionable whether they do not appertain
rather to the trickery of thought’s vehicle, than to
thought itself—rather to reason’s shadow than to
reason. Truth, for truth’s sake, is seldom so enforced.
It is scarcely too much to say that the style
of the profound thinker is never closely logical.
Here we might instance George Combe—than whom
a more candid reasoner never, perhaps, wrote or
spoke—than whom a more complete antipodes to
Babington Macaulay there certainly never existed.
The former <span class='it'>reasons</span> to discover the true. The latter
<span class='it'>argues</span> to convince the world, and, in arguing, not
unfrequently surprises himself into conviction. What
Combe appear to Macaulay it would be a difficult
thing to say. What Macaulay is thought of by Combe
we can understand very well. The man who looks
at an argument in its details alone, will not fail to be
misled by the one; while he who keeps steadily in
view the <span class='it'>generality</span> of a thesis will always at least
approximate the truth under guidance of the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Macaulay’s tendency—and the tendency of mere
logic in general—to concentrate force upon minutiæ,
at the expense of a subject as a whole, is well instanced
in an article (in the volume now before us) on
Ranke’s History of the Popes. This article is called
a review—possibly because it is anything else—<span class='it'>as
lucus</span> is <span class='it'>lucus a non lucendo</span>. In fact it is nothing
more than a beautifully written treatise on the main
theme of Ranke himself; the whole matter of the
treatise being deduced from the History. In the way
of criticism there is nothing worth the name. The
strength of the essayist is put forth to account for the
progress of Romanism by maintaining that divinity is
not a progressive science. The enigmas, says he in
substance, which perplex the natural theologian are
the same in all ages, while the Bible, where alone we
are to seek revealed truth, has always been what it is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The manner in which these two propositions are
set forth, is a model for the logician and for the student
of <span class='it'>belles lettres</span>—yet the error into which the
essayist has rushed headlong, is egregious. He attempts
to deceive his readers, or has deceived himself,
by confounding the nature of that proof from
which we reason of the concerns of earth, considered
as man’s habitation, and the nature of that evidence
from which we reason of the same earth regarded as
a unit of that vast whole, the universe. In the former
case the <span class='it'>data</span> being palpable, the proof is direct: in
the latter it is purely <span class='it'>analogical</span>. Were the indications
we derive from science, of the nature and designs
of Deity, and thence, by inference, of man’s
destiny—were these indications proof direct, no
advance in science would strengthen them—for, as
our author truly observes, “nothing could be added
to the force of the argument which the mind finds in
every beast, bird, or flower”—but as these indications
are rigidly analogical, every step in human
knowledge—every astronomical discovery, for instance—throws
additional light upon the august subject,
<span class='it'>by extending the range of analogy</span>. That we
know no more to-day of the nature of Deity—of its
purposes—and thus of man himself—than we did
even a dozen years ago—is a proposition disgracefully
absurd; and of this any astronomer could assure
Mr. Macaulay. Indeed, to our own mind, the <span class='it'>only</span>
irrefutable argument in support of the soul’s immortality—or,
rather, the only conclusive proof of man’s
alternate dissolution and re-juvenescence <span class='it'>ad infinitum</span>—is
to be found in analogies deduced from the modern
established theory of the nebular cosmogony.<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a> Mr.
Macaulay, in short, has forgotten what he frequently
forgets, or neglects,—the very gist of his subject.
He has forgotten that analogical evidence cannot, at
all times, be discoursed of as if identical with proof
direct. Throughout the whole of his treatise he has
made no distinction whatever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This third volume completes, we believe, the miscellaneous
writings of its author.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>“Corse de Leon: or the Brigand.” A Romance. By
G. P. R. James. 2 vols. Harper &amp; Brothers.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Bernard de Rohan and Isabel de Brienne are betrothed
to each other in childhood, but the father of
the latter dying, and her mother marrying again, the
union of the two lovers is opposed by the father-in-law,
the Lord of Masseran, who has another husband
in view for her, the Count de Meyrand. To escape
his persecutions, the heroine elopes, and is married
in a private chapel to De Rohan; but just as the ceremony
has closed, the pair are surprised by Masseran
and Meynard, who fling the hero into a dungeon, and
bear off Isabel. The young wife manages to escape,
however, and reaches Paris to throw herself on the
protection of the King, Henry the Second. Here she
learns that her husband, whom the monarch had ordered
to be freed, has perished in a conflagration of
Masseran’s castle; and she determines to take the veil.
In vain the king endeavors to persuade her to wait.
She is inflexible, until surprised by the re-appearance
of de Rohan, who, instead of perishing as supposed,
has been rescued, unknown, by Corse de Leon, a
stern, wild, yet withal, generous sort of a brigand,
with whom he had become accidentally acquainted on
the frontiers of Savoy. As the stolen marriage of the
lovers has been revoked by a royal edict, it is necessary
that the ceremony should be repeated. A week
hence is named for the wedding, but before that time
arrives de Rohan not only fights—unavoidably of
course—with his rival, which the monarch has forbidden,
but is accused by Masseran of the murder of
Isabel’s brother in a remote province of France. De
Rohan is tried, found guilty and condemned to die;
but on the eve of execution is rescued by his good
genius, the brigand. He flies his country, and in disguise
joins the army in Italy, where he greatly distinguishes
himself. Finally, he storms and carries a
castle, by the assistance of Corse de Leon, which
Meyrand, now an outlaw, is holding out against France;
at the same time rescuing his long lost bride from the
clutches of the count, into which she had fallen by
the sack of a neighboring abbey. In the dungeon of
the captured castle Isabel’s brother is discovered, he
having been confined there by Masseran, prior to
charging de Rohan with his murder. After a little
farther bye-play, which only spoils the work, and
which we shall not notice, the lovers are united,
and thenceforth “all goes merry as a marriage
bell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the outline of the plot—well enough in its
way; but partaking largely of the common-place, and
marred by the conclusion, which we have omitted,
and which was introduced only for the purpose of
introducing the famous death of Henry the Second,
at a tournament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The characters, however, are still more common-place.
De Rohan and Isabel are like all James’
lovers, mere nothings—Father Welland and Corse de
Leon are the beneficent spirits, and Meyrand and
Masseran are the evil geniuses, of the novel. The
other characters are lifeless, common, and uncharacteristic.
They make no impression, and you almost
forget their names. There is no originality in any of
them, and save a passage of fine writing here and
there, nothing to be praised in the book. Corse de
Leon, the principal character, talks philosophy like
Bulwer’s heroes, and is altogether a plagiarism from
that bombastic, unnatural, cut-throat school,—besides,
he possesses a universality of knowledge, combined
with a commensurable power, which, although they
get the hero very conveniently out of scrapes, belie
all nature. In short, this is but a readable novel, and
a mere repetition of the author’s former works.</p>

or affect a <span class='it'>penchant</span> for vulgarity; nor can we comprehend
the “moral dignity” of a dissertation upon
bed-bugs: for the opening part of “Insubordination”
is, if anything, a treatise on these peculiar animalculæ.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some portions of the book are worthy of the author’s
ability, which it would rejoice us to see more
profitably occupied. For example, a passage where
Jimmy, an ill-treated orphan, relates to the only friend
he has ever found, some of the poignant sorrows of
his childhood, embodies a fine theme, handled in a
manner which has seldom been excelled. Its pathos
is exquisite. The morality of the story is no doubt
good; but the reasoning by which it is urged is decrepid,
and far too pertinaciously thrust into the reader’s
face at every page. The mode in which all the characters
are <span class='it'>reformed</span>, one after the other, belongs
rather to the desirable than to the credible. The style
of the narrative is easy and <span class='it'>truthful</span>. We dare say
the work will prove popular in a certain sense; but,
upon the whole, we do not like it.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>“Marathon, and Other Poems.” By Pliny Earle,
M. D. Henry Perkins, Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We have long had a very high opinion of the talents
of Doctor Earle; and it gives us sincere pleasure to
see his poems in book form. The publication will
place him at once in the front rank of our bards. His
qualities are all of a sterling character—a high imagination,
delighting in lofty themes—a rigorous simplicity,
disdaining verbiage and meretricious ornament—a
thorough knowledge of the proprieties of metre—and
an ear nicely attuned to its delicacies. In addition,
he feels as a man, and thinks and writes as a scholar.
His general manner, puts us much in mind of Halleck.
“Marathon,” the longest poem in the volume before
us, is fully equal to the “Bozzaris” of that writer;
although we confess that between the two poems
there exists a similarity in tone and construction
which we would rather not have observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the present number of our Magazine will be
found a very beautiful composition by the author of
“Marathon.” It exhibits all the rare beauties of
its author.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>“Selections from the Poetical Literature of the West.”
U. P. James; Cincinnati.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This handsomely printed volume fills a long-regretted
<span class='it'>hiatus</span> in our poetical literature, and we are much
indebted to Mr. James the publisher; and to Mr. William
D. Gallagher, who has superintended the compilation.
We are told, in the Preface by Mr. G. that
the book “is not sent forth as by any means the
whole of the ‘Poetical Literature of the West,’ but
that it is believed it will represent its <span class='it'>character</span> pretty
faithfully, as it certainly contains samples of its
greatest excellences, its mediocre qualities, and its
worst defects.” It may be questioned, indeed, how
far we are to thank the editor for troubling us with
the “defects,” or, what in poesy is still worse, with
the “mediocre qualities” of any literature whatever.
It is no apology to say that the design was to represent
“character”—for who cares for the character of
that man or of that poem which has no character at all?</p>

<p class='pindent'>By these observations we mean merely to insinuate,
as delicately as possible, that Mr. Gallagher has admitted
into this volume a great deal of trash with
which the public could well have dispensed. On the
other hand we recognise many poems of a high order
of excellence; among which we may mention an
“Ode to the Press” by G. G. Foster, of the St. Louis
Pennant; several sweet pieces by our friend F. W.
Thomas, of “Clinton Bradshaw” memory; “The
Flight of Years” by George D. Prentice; “To the
Star Lyra,” by William Wallace; and the “Miami
Woods,” by Mr. Gallagher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have spoken of this latter gentleman as the
<span class='it'>editor</span> of the volume—but presume that in so speaking
we have been in error. It is probable that, the
volume having been compiled by some other hand, he
was requested by Mr. James to write the Preface
merely. We are forced into this conclusion by observing
that the poems of William D. Gallagher
occupy more room in the book than those of any
other author, and that the “Miami Woods” just
mentioned—lines written by himself—form the opening
article of the work. We cannot believe that Mr.
G. would have been so wanting in modesty as to
perpetrate these improprieties as <span class='it'>editor</span> of the “Poetical
Literature of the West.”</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>“The Quadroone.” A Novel. By the Author of
“Lafitte,” &amp;c. Harper &amp; Brothers, New York.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We see no good reason for differing with that general
sentence of condemnation which has been pronounced
upon this book, both at home and abroad—and
less for attempting anything in the way of an
extended review of its contents. This was our design
upon hearing the novel announced; but an inspection
of its pages assures us that the labor would be misplaced.
Nothing that we could say—had we even the
disposition to say it—would convince any sensible man
that “The Quadroone” is not a very bad book—such
a book as Professor Ingraham (for whom we have a
high personal respect) ought to be ashamed of. <span class='it'>We</span>
are ashamed of it.</p>
